    "question": "During my opponent's turn, I activate Urgent Ritual Art by banishing Machine Angel Ritual from my Graveyard, and Ritual Summon a Cyber Angel Dakini. In this case, can I activate the effect of Cyber Angel Dakini that makes my opponent send a monster on their field to the Graveyard?",
    "answer": "When resolving the effect of Urgent Ritual Art that was activated by banishing Machine Angel Ritual, if Cyber Angel Dakini is Ritual Summoned during your opponent's turn, you can still activate its effect. Note that even if Urgent Ritual Art was activated as Chain Link 2 or higher, and Cyber Angel Dakini is Ritual Summoned when it resolves, you can activate the effect of Cyber Angel Dakini.",
    "llm_answer": "No, you cannot activate the effect of Cyber Angel Dakini that makes your opponent send a monster to the Graveyard. \n\nThe effect of Cyber Angel Dakini states that it can be activated \"If this card is Ritual Summoned\". Since Urgent Ritual Art is a Trap Card, its activation timing does not align with the timing for Cyber Angel Dakini's effect, which specifies that it must be activated when the card itself is Ritual Summoned. Therefore, even though Cyber Angel Dakini is successfully Ritual Summoned through Urgent Ritual Art, the timing for its effect to activate has been missed."
