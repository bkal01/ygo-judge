    "question": "I activated 2 copies of Abyss Script - Fire Dragon's Lair, each targeting my Abyss Actor - Evil Heel. This turn, if Abyss Actor - Evil Heel destroys an opponent's monster by battle, will the effects of each Abyss Script - Fire Dragon's Lair apply?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, if a monster that was targeted with 2 different copies of Abyss Script - Fire Dragon's Lair destroys an opponent's monster by battle this turn, the effect of each copy is applied. (As a result, your opponent banishes a total of 6 monsters from their Extra Deck.)",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, the effects of both copies of **Abyss Script - Fire Dragon's Lair** will apply. \n\n**Abyss Script - Fire Dragon's Lair** states: \"Target 1 'Abyss Actor' monster you control; if it destroys your opponent's monster by battle this turn, your opponent banishes 3 monsters from their Extra Deck (their choice).\" \n\nSince you activated two copies of this card, each targeting the same **Abyss Actor - Evil Heel**, and both effects are independent, when **Abyss Actor - Evil Heel** destroys an opponent's monster by battle, both copies of **Abyss Script - Fire Dragon's Lair** will trigger, forcing your opponent to banish 3 monsters from their Extra Deck for each copy, resulting in a total of 6 monsters being banished."
