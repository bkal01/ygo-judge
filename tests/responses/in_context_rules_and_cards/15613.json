    "question": "If the effect of Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora is activated in a chain to the activation of the effect of Tamtam the Melodious Diva that reduces ATK and inflicts damage, so that the targeted monster becomes unaffected by card effects, how does this resolve?",
    "answer": "In that case, since the part of the effect that reduces ATK cannot be applied, the part of the effect that inflicts damage is not applied either.",
    "llm_answer": "If the effect of **Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora** is activated in a chain to the effect of **Tamtam the Melodious Diva**:\n\n- **Tamtam's Effect**: The effect of Tamtam the Melodious Diva would attempt to target a \"Melodious\" monster you control, reduce its ATK by 500, and inflict 500 damage to your opponent.\n  \n- **Superdreadnought's Effect**: If Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora's effect is activated in a chain, detaching one material and making the targeted monster unaffected by card effects, **Tamtam's effect will not apply** to the targeted monster. The monster will remain unaffected by Tamtam's effect, meaning its ATK will not be reduced and no damage will be inflicted.\n\n**Resolution**: Since the targeted monster is made unaffected by card effects by Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora's effect, Tamtam the Melodious Diva's effect will resolve without any impact on the monster or the opponent's LP."
