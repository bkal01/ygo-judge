    "question": "My opponent only has 4 Sheep Tokens (0 ATK) on their side of the field, and my Life Points are 6000 while my opponent's are 3000. Can I activate the second effect of Dried Winds in this situation?",
    "answer": "In this case, you can activate the effect of Dried Winds by paying 3000 Life Points. The effect will destroy monsters on your opponent's side of the field whose total ATK is less than or equal to 3000, so you can choose any number of Sheep Tokens to destroy.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can activate the second effect of **Dried Winds** in this situation. Since your Life Points are 6000 and your opponent's Life Points are 3000, you have a difference of 3000 LP. The combined ATK of the 4 Sheep Tokens is 0, which is less than or equal to the 3000 LP difference you would pay to activate the effect. Therefore, you can pay 3000 LP to destroy all four Sheep Tokens."
