    "question": "I control two copies of Evil HERO Malicious Fiend, and each of their\u300eeach monster they control must attack this card, if able\u300feffects is applying. Which monster, if either, must my opponent's monsters now attack?",
    "answer": "Your opponent's monster will attack one of your monsters. When the attack is declared, you, the player whose monster is being attacked, will choose which of the\u300eyour opponent's monsters must attack \u205c\u205c\u205c, if able\u300feffects to apply for this attack.\n\n~~~\n\nSimilarly, also for the following cards'\u300eyour opponent's monsters must attack \u205c\u205c\u205c, if able\u300feffects: Terra Firma Gravity, Volcanic Doomfire, Number iC1000: Numerounius Numerounia, Magical Trick Mirror, G Golem Invalid Dolmen, G Golem Dignified Trilithon, Number 31: Embodiment of Punishment, Number 13: Embodiment of Crime, Puppet Rook, Hypnosister, Mystical Elf - White Lightning, Light Law Medium, Nightmare Pain, Mementotlan Cranium Burst, and Heavenly Gate of the Mikanko.",
    "llm_answer": "Since both copies of **Evil HERO Malicious Fiend** have the effect that says, \"each monster they control must attack this card, if able,\" this creates a situation where both monsters are mandating attacks. Here\u2019s how this resolves:\n\n- **When multiple effects apply simultaneously**: If multiple effects that mandate actions are active at the same time, the effects are not cumulative in a way that would require a player to choose one monster over the other. Instead, the opponent's monsters **must attack one of the two Evil HERO Malicious Fiends** during their Battle Phase, but the opponent has the **choice** on which one they attack.\n\n**Resolution:** The opponent's monsters must attack one of your Evil HERO Malicious Fiends. The opponent can choose which one they will attack. If there are multiple attackable monsters on the opponent's side, they must distribute their attacks in a manner that fulfills the effect of at least one Malicious Fiend, but they can choose which one to attack with each monster. However, they cannot choose to not attack if they have monsters able to do so."
