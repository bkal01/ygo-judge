    "question": "I activate Halfway to Forever, targeting a Gagaga Magician and a Gogogo Golem in my Graveyard. If my opponent chains the effect of their D.D. Crow and banishes Gagaga Magician from my Graveyard, how does the effect of Halfway to Forever resolve?",
    "answer": "As in this scenario, if either of the 2 targeted monsters is no longer in the Graveyard when Halfway to Forever resolves, its effect is not applied. (Gogogo Golem remains in the Graveyard, and you do not perform an Xyz Summon.)",
    "llm_answer": "If your opponent chains D.D. Crow to **Halfway to Forever** and banishes **Gagaga Magician** from your Graveyard:\n\n- **Halfway to Forever** will still resolve, but only **Gogogo Golem** will be Special Summoned from your Graveyard. Since **Gagaga Magician** was banished, it is no longer in the Graveyard and cannot be Special Summoned by **Halfway to Forever**. \n\n- Because **Gogogo Golem** is the only monster that can be Special Summoned by the effect, the Xyz Summon part of **Halfway to Forever** cannot be performed as there are not two monsters to use as materials for the Xyz Summon.\n\n**Resolution:** **Gogogo Golem** is Special Summoned from your Graveyard in face-up Defense Position with its effects negated. The Xyz Summon does not occur because there is only one monster available for the Xyz Summon."
