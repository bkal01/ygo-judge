    "question": "Can the effect of Twilight Ninja Getsuga, the Shogun be activated if you have no available Monster Zones?",
    "answer": "No, it cannot.",
    "llm_answer": "No, the effect of Twilight Ninja Getsuga, the Shogun cannot be activated if you have no available Monster Zones. The effect of Getsuga would Special Summon 2 \"Ninja\" monsters from the Graveyard, and if there are no available Monster Zones, the Special Summon cannot be performed. Therefore, since the effect cannot resolve properly, it cannot be activated in this scenario."
