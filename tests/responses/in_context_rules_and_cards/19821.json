    "question": "I activate Abyss Actors Back Stage, but then chain my own Needlebug Nest and send 5 cards from the top of my Deck to the Graveyard. As a result, if the only remaining \"Abyss Actor\" Pendulum Monsters in my Deck when Abyss Actors Back Stage resolves are 2 copies of Abyss Actor - Sassy Rookie, what happens?",
    "answer": "The effect of Abyss Actors Back Stage must add 2 \"Abyss Actor\" Pendulum Monsters with different names from your Main Deck to your Extra Deck. In this scenario, since the only \"Abyss Actor\" Pendulum Monsters in your Deck are copies of Abyss Actor - Sassy Rookie, the effect of Abyss Actors Back Stage is not applied. (No monsters are added to your Extra Deck.)",
    "llm_answer": "**Answer:** Abyss Actors Back Stage cannot resolve properly.\n\n**Explanation:** Since the effect of Abyss Actors Back Stage says \"Add 2 'Abyss Actor' Pendulum Monsters with different names from your Deck to your Extra Deck face-up,\" and you only have 2 copies of Abyss Actor - Sassy Rookie with the same name, you cannot add them to your Extra Deck. As a result, the effect does not resolve."
