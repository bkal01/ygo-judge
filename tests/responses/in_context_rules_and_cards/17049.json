    "question": "While the effect of Cuben is applying, if the die result was 4, but then Cuben changes control by the effect of Creature Swap, does the effect still apply normally?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, if the effect of Cuben has already resolved, even if Cuben changes control to your opponent by the effect of Creature Swap, its effect will continue applying normally. (In this case, neither player can Normal or Special Summon Level 4 monsters.)",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, the effect of **Cuben** still applies normally even after it changes control due to **Creature Swap**. Here's why:\n\n- **Cuben**'s effect states that **\"while this monster is face-up on the field, neither player can Normal or Special Summon monsters with the same Level as the result.\"** This effect is **continuous** and does not specify that it only applies to the controller of Cuben.\n\n- **Creature Swap** switches control of monsters but does not negate or remove the effects of the monsters involved. It only restricts the monsters' ability to change their battle positions for the rest of the turn.\n\n**Resolution:** The effect of Cuben continues to apply, preventing both players from Normal or Special Summoning monsters with a Level equal to the die result, regardless of who controls Cuben."
