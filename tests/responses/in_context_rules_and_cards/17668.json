    "question": "If the opponent activates Enemy Controller in a chain to the activation of the effect of Super Quantal Mech Beast Magnaliger, Super Quantal Mech Beast Aeroboros, or Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse that attaches an Xyz Material to itself, so that control of Super Quantal Mech Beast Magnaliger or similar switches to the opponent, how does this resolve?",
    "answer": "Even in that case, the effect resolves normally.\n\n(A \"Super Quantum Mecha Pilot\" monster in the hand or face-up on your side of the field is attached to the monster that switched control to the opponent as an Xyz Material)",
    "llm_answer": "The effect of **Super Quantal Mech Beast Magnaliger**, **Super Quantal Mech Beast Aeroboros**, or **Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse** that attaches a \"Super Quantum\" monster as an Xyz Material does not target. This means the effect can still resolve even if control of the Xyz monster changes to the opponent during the chain.\n\n**Resolution**: \n- If the opponent activates **Enemy Controller** in a chain to the activation of the effect of **Super Quantal Mech Beast Magnaliger**, **Super Quantal Mech Beast Aeroboros**, or **Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse** to take control of the Xyz monster, the effect of attaching a \"Super Quantum\" monster as an Xyz Material will still resolve. The Xyz monster will attach the material from the hand or field of the original controller (now the opponent's field) to itself as an Xyz Material."
