    "title": "If I control a face-up Block Dragon, will my Koa'ki Meiru Overload be destroyed during the End Phase?",
    "question": "A face-up Block Dragon on my field is applying its effect, preventing Rock monsters from being destroyed, except by battle. If I fail to reveal a Rock monster during the End Phase, and do not send Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru to the Graveyard, will my Koa'ki Meiru Overload still be destroyed?",
    "answer": "If that effect of Block Dragon is applying, face-up Rock monsters you control cannot be destroyed, except by battle.\n\nTherefore, in the given situation, Koa'ki Meiru Overload will not be destroyed during the End Phase, and will remain in your Monster Zone.\n(However, you can still choose to reveal a Rock monster, or send Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru to the Graveyard, if you wish.)",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, your **Koa'ki Meiru Overload** will be destroyed during the End Phase if you do not reveal a Rock monster in your hand or send an **Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru** from your hand to the Graveyard. \n\nThe effect text of **Koa'ki Meiru Overload** specifies that it will be destroyed if you fail to meet the condition during your End Phase. The effect of **Block Dragon** that prevents Rock monsters from being destroyed only applies to destruction by effects other than its own maintenance cost. Since the destruction of **Koa'ki Meiru Overload** is a result of not fulfilling its own maintenance condition, **Block Dragon**'s effect does not protect it from this destruction.\n\n**Resolution:** If you fail to reveal a Rock monster or send **Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru** to the Graveyard during the End Phase, **Koa'ki Meiru Overload** will be destroyed as per its own effect text."
