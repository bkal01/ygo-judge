    "answer": "When the effect of Brilliant Fusion resolves, if the Fusion Monster is unaffected by Spell effects, it does not gain ATK and DEF from the effect of Brilliant Fusion. Also, if the effect of Brilliant Fusion has already been applied, and the Fusion Monster then becomes unaffected by Spell effects, the ATK and DEF gained by the effect continues to apply. (From that value, the effect of Forbidden Lance will make the monster lose 800 ATK.)",
    "llm_answer": "If **Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli** is Fusion Summoned by **Brilliant Fusion**:\n\n- **First Scenario**: If **Brilliant Fusion**'s second effect is activated to increase Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli's ATK and DEF, but **Forbidden Lance** is chained, making Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli unaffected by Spell effects:\n  - **Resolution**: Since Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli is unaffected by other Spell effects when Forbidden Lance resolves, the effect of Brilliant Fusion that would increase its ATK and DEF to its original values does not apply. Therefore, **Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli's ATK and DEF remain at 0**.\n\n- **Second Scenario**: If the effect of **Brilliant Fusion** has already been applied, increasing Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli's ATK and DEF to their original values, and then **Forbidden Lance** is activated:\n  - **Resolution**: Once the effect of Brilliant Fusion has been applied, and Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli's ATK and DEF are already increased, **Forbidden Lance** will not revert those changes because the ATK/DEF increase was not an effect of a Spell card at the time of Lance's activation but rather a condition set by Brilliant Fusion upon leaving the field. Thus, **Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli's ATK and DEF stay at their increased values** (2400 ATK and 1000 DEF) until the end of your opponent's turn. However, she would be unaffected by any other Spell/Trap effects for the rest of the turn."
