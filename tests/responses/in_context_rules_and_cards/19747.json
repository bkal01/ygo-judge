As a result, both Performapal Lebellman and Performapal Trampolynx are now Level 4. In this situation, if my opponent activates Skill Drain so that the effects of Performapal Lebellman are negated, what happens to my monsters' Levels?",
    "question": "The monster effect of Performapal Lebellman is activated by declaring Level 2, targeting my Performapal Trampolynx. As a result, both Performapal Lebellman and Performapal Trampolynx are now Level 4. In this situation, if my opponent activates Skill Drain so that the effects of Performapal Lebellman are negated, what happens to my monsters' Levels?",
    "answer": "After the monster effect of Performapal Lebellman has resolved, even if the effect of Skill Drain is applied, the Level of that Performapal Lebellman remains reduced, and the targeted monster's Level remains increased. (In this scenario, both Performapal Lebellman and Performapal Trampolynx remain Level 4. At the end of the turn, their Levels return to their original values normally.)",
    "llm_answer": "The Levels of both **Performapal Lebellman** and **Performapal Trampolynx** **remain at Level 4**. The effect that changed the Levels of these monsters is not a continuous effect, but rather an activated effect that has already resolved. Therefore, even if the effects of **Performapal Lebellman** are negated by **Skill Drain**, the Levels of the monsters do not revert back to their original values."
