    "question": "When my opponent activates the effect of Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring from their hand, can I activate the\u300enegate the activation, and if you do, banish that card\u300feffect of Orcust Crescendo in response?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can. If you do, the activation of Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring's effect will be negated. However, since Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring no longer exists in the location where its effect was activated, (the effect was activated by the Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring in your hand, which was then discarded as a cost,) Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring will not be banished by Orcust Crescendo.\n\nThe same applies to the following effects, if they are used in response to the activation of the effect of Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring: Myutant Ultimus, Shooting Majestic Star Dragon, Nekroz of Areadbhair, Dragunity Knight - Areadbhair, Cynet Conflict, Tri-Gate Wizard, Invoked Mechaba, Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju, Infernoid Devyaty, and Debunk.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can activate the effect of Orcust Crescendo in response to Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring's activation. \n\nHere is the reasoning:\n- **Orcust Crescendo** can negate the activation of a Spell/Trap Card or a monster effect when you control an \"Orcust\" Link Monster.\n- **Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring** activates its effect from the hand as a Quick Effect, which has a Spell Speed of 2.\n\nSince Orcust Crescendo is a Counter Trap Card with a Spell Speed of 3, it can be activated in a chain directly to Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring's effect activation to negate it. \n\n**Resolution:** The effect of Orcust Crescendo will negate the activation of Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring's effect and banish it if you do."
