    "question": "While Imperial Iron Wall is face-up on my field, I Pendulum Summon an Double Iris Magician and White Wing Magician. In this case, is it possible to use White Wing Magician as a <<9241>> monster?",
    "answer": "Even in this scenario, you can use the Pendulum Summoned White Wing Magician as a <<9241>> monster. In that case, due to the effect of Imperial Iron Wall, White Wing Magician is not banished and is added face-up to the Extra Deck.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can use **White Wing Magician** as a **Synchro Material** monster. \n\n**Imperial Iron Wall** prevents cards from being banished, but it does not affect the conditions under which a monster can be used as a Synchro Material. The effect of **White Wing Magician** that says \"If this Pendulum Summoned card is used for a Synchro Summon, banish it\" is a condition that applies after the Synchro Summon, not a requirement for using it as a Synchro Material. Therefore, **White Wing Magician** can still be used as a Synchro Material while **Imperial Iron Wall** is active, but it will not be banished after the Synchro Summon due to **Imperial Iron Wall**'s effect."
