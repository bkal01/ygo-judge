    "question": "An Ally of Justice Nullfier battles a White Duston. After damage calculation, will the effect of Ally of Justice Nullfier activate?",
    "answer": "White Duston is a LIGHT Normal Monster, but even in this case, since Ally of Justice Nullfier battled a LIGHT monster, its effect will activate after damage calculation. A Chain Link will be created, but since White Duston is a Normal Monster, no effect is negated.",
    "llm_answer": "**Answer:** No, the effect of **Ally of Justice Nullfier** will not activate.\n\n**Reasoning:** The effect of Ally of Justice Nullfier activates specifically when it battles a LIGHT monster. However, **White Duston** is a LIGHT monster, but its effect does not meet the requirements for Ally of Justice Nullfier's effect to activate. The effect of Ally of Justice Nullfier states that it activates \"after damage calculation\" when battling a LIGHT monster to negate the effects of that monster. Since White Duston is a Normal Monster with no effects, there are no effects to negate, thus the effect of Ally of Justice Nullfier will not activate. \n\n**Resolution:** After damage calculation, no effect is activated by **Ally of Justice Nullfier** because **White Duston** has no effects to be negated."
