    "title": "If a monster is flipped face-up while Terrors in the Hidden City's effects are negated, and the effect of Terrors in the Hidden City is then reapplied, will the monster gain ATK/DEF?",
    "question": "My opponent's White Howling has resolved, negating the effects of my Terrors in the Hidden City until the end of the turn. A monster I control is then flipped face-up while the effects of Terrors in the Hidden City remain negated.\n\nWhen the effects of Terrors in the Hidden City begin applying again at the end of this turn, will that monster's ATK/DEF be increased by that effect?",
    "answer": "Yes, the monster is still a monster that was flipped face-up while Terrors in the Hidden City was face-up. Therefore, it will gain ATK/DEF due to Terrors in the Hidden City's effect.",
    "llm_answer": "The monster's ATK/DEF will not be increased by the effect of **Terrors in the Hidden City** at the end of the turn. \n\n**Reasoning:** The effect of **White Howling** negates all Spell effects on your opponent's field for the rest of the turn. Since **Terrors in the Hidden City** is a Continuous Spell Card, its effects, including the one that increases ATK/DEF of flipped monsters, are negated until the end of the turn. This means the monster that was flipped face-up while **Terrors in the Hidden City**'s effects were negated will not gain the ATK/DEF boost when the negation wears off at the end of the turn. \n\n**Scenario Resolution:** The monster will remain with its original ATK/DEF when **White Howling**'s effect ends."
