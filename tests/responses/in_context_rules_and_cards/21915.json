    "question": "Skill Drain is face-up in my opponent's Spell & Trap Zone, and its effect that negates the effects of face-up monsters on the field is applying. In this situation, if a Special Summoned Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon leaves the field, will it be placed on the bottom of the Deck?",
    "answer": "Even if the effects of Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon are negated by Skill Drain, the effect that places it on the bottom of the Deck will be applied when it leaves the field.",
    "llm_answer": "**Answer:** No, it will not be placed on the bottom of the Deck. \n\n**Reasoning:** The effect that returns Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon to the bottom of the Deck is not a Continuous Effect, but rather an effect that applies when the card leaves the field. Since Skill Drain only negates the effects of face-up monsters **while they are face-up on the field**, this effect will not be negated. However, the card's Pendulum Effect, which can be activated from the Pendulum Zone, would be negated by Skill Drain if Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon were in the Pendulum Zone. \n\n**Resolution:** When Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon leaves the field, it will be sent to the Graveyard, not returned to the bottom of the Deck."
