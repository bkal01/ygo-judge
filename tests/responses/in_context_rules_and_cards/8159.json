    "question": "When Obelisk the Tormentor is Tribute Summoned, how long does its effect that prevents cards and effects from being activated apply? Will this effect prevent cards and effects from being activated for the rest of the Duel?",
    "answer": "The effect of Obelisk the Tormentor that prevents cards and effects from being activated when it is Normal Summoned only applies at the time it is successfully Summoned. This effect does not prevent cards and effects from activating for the rest of the Duel, so after Obelisk the Tormentor has been successfully Tribute Summoned, cards and effects can be activated normally. (For example, when Obelisk the Tormentor is Tribute Summoned, cards such as Bottomless Trap Hole cannot be activated at that time, but cards like Mirror Force can be activated normally when Obelisk the Tormentor declares an attack.)",
    "llm_answer": "The effect of Obelisk the Tormentor that prevents cards and effects from being activated only applies **when it is Normal Summoned**. This means that once Obelisk the Tormentor is successfully Tribute Summoned, for the rest of the turn in which it was summoned, cards and effects cannot be activated in response to the Summon. \n\nHowever, **this effect does not prevent cards and effects from being activated for the rest of the Duel**. After Obelisk the Tormentor's successful Tribute Summon, players can activate cards and effects during their subsequent turns, or during the same turn after the initial Summoning event has passed. \n\n**Resolution**: Once Obelisk the Tormentor is Tribute Summoned, players cannot activate cards or effects during that turn in response to its Summon. After that turn, cards and effects can be activated normally."
