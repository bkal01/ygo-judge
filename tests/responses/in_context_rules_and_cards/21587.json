    "answer": "When performing a Fusion Summon using the effect of Gem-Knight Phantom Quartz, you can include Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and/or Link Monsters as materials. For example, if you Fusion Summon a Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli, which requires Gem-Knight Lapis and another \"Gem-Knight\" monster, you can use a Gem-Knight Lapis and a Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond in your Graveyard as materials. (Gem-Knight Lapis returns to the Deck, but Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond returns to the Extra Deck.)",
    "llm_answer": "No, you cannot include Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link Monsters as materials for the Fusion Summon with the effect of **Gem-Knight Phantom Quartz**. The card's effect specifically states that you can use materials that are \"banished or in the Graveyard,\" but **Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link Monsters do not have a Level**. Since the materials for a Fusion Summon typically require monsters with Levels, these Extra Deck monsters are not valid for this Fusion Summon.\n\n**Gem-Knight Phantom Quartz** will only allow you to use materials that meet the Fusion Material requirements listed on the \"Gem-Knight\" Fusion Monster you are attempting to Fusion Summon, and these monsters must have Levels. Therefore, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link Monsters cannot be used for this Fusion Summon."
