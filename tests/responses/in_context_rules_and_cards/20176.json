    "question": "If my Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon attacks my opponent's Flower Cardian Lightflare, and Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon is destroyed by battle, is it possible to activate the effect of Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon that banishes the opponent's battling monster at the end of the Damage Step?",
    "answer": "Even in this scenario, since Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon attacked an opponent's monster, but that monster was not destroyed by battle, you can activate its effect. In this case, since Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates in the Graveyard. Although the effect of Flower Cardian Lightflare negates the effects of monsters that battle \"Flower Cardian\" monsters, the effect of Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon that activates in the Graveyard is not negated.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, it is possible to activate the effect of Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon that banishes the opponent's Flower Cardian Lightflare at the end of the Damage Step even if Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon is destroyed by battle. The effect of Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon specifies that it triggers \"at the end of the Damage Step, when this card attacks an opponent's monster, but the opponent's monster was not destroyed by the battle.\" Since Flower Cardian Lightflare was not destroyed by the battle, the condition for Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon's effect is met, allowing you to banish Flower Cardian Lightflare at the end of the Damage Step."
