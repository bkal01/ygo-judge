    "question": "My Salamangreat Heatleo is in the Extra Monster Zone. In this situation, when I activate the effect of a Salamangreat Jack Jaguar in my Graveyard, targeting a Salamangreat Falco in my Graveyard, what happens if my opponent chains Compulsory Evacuation Device and returns Salamangreat Heatleo to the Extra Deck?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, since you no longer have a \"Salamangreat\" Link Monster on your field, you still apply the part of the effect that returns Salamangreat Falco to the Deck, but you cannot Special Summon Salamangreat Jack Jaguar to a zone a \"Salamangreat\" Link Monster points to, and it remains in your Graveyard.",
    "llm_answer": "If your **Salamangreat Heatleo** is in the Extra Monster Zone and you activate the effect of **Salamangreat Jack Jaguar** in your Graveyard, targeting **Salamangreat Falco** in your Graveyard, and your opponent chains **Compulsory Evacuation Device** to return **Salamangreat Heatleo** to the Extra Deck:\n\n- **Salamangreat Jack Jaguar's** effect requires that you control a \"Salamangreat\" Link Monster to activate its effect from the Graveyard. \n- When **Compulsory Evacuation Device** resolves, **Salamangreat Heatleo** is no longer on the field, which means you do not control a \"Salamangreat\" Link Monster at the time **Salamangreat Jack Jaguar's** effect would resolve.\n\n**The Scenario Resolves:**\n- Since the condition for **Salamangreat Jack Jaguar's** effect (controlling a \"Salamangreat\" Link Monster) is not met at the time of resolution due to **Salamangreat Heatleo** being returned to the Extra Deck, **Salamangreat Jack Jaguar's** effect does not resolve properly. **Salamangreat Jack Jaguar** remains in the Graveyard, and **Salamangreat Falco** is not shuffled into the Deck, nor is **Salamangreat Jack Jaguar** Special Summoned."
