    "title": "Can the effect of Fabled Andwraith summon my opponent's Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring that was discarded to activate its effect?",
    "question": "While I control a Fabled Andwraith, I activate Foolish Burial. In response, my opponent activates the effect of Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring by discarding it.\n\nIn this case, can I use the effect of Fabled Andwraith to Special Summon that Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring with its effects negated?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can.\n\nThe Trigger Effect of Fabled Andwraith in question can be activated in a new Chain after resolving the current Chain where Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring negated the effect of Foolish Burial. (The effect is not activated immediately when the monster is sent to the Graveyard.)\n\nIn the given situation, the effect of Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring activated as Chain Link 2 negates the effect of Foolish Burial activated as Chain Link 1. Then, after the Chain has resolved, the effect of Fabled Andwraith can be activated as Chain Link 1 in a new Chain.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can use the effect of Fabled Andwraith to Special Summon the Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring that was discarded by its own effect.\n\nWhen Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring is discarded, it is sent from the opponent's hand to the Graveyard, which meets the activation requirement for Fabled Andwraith's second effect. Since Fabled Andwraith's effect specifies that you can Special Summon a monster sent from your opponent's hand to the GY, you can target the discarded Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring and Special Summon it with its effects negated.\n\n**Resolution:** After Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring's effect resolves and negates Foolish Burial, if your opponent does not discard a card to negate the effect of Fabled Andwraith, you can activate Fabled Andwraith's effect to Special Summon Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring with its effects negated."
