If I activate Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast and there are 3 or more Spell Cards in my Graveyard, how do I apply the part of the effect that returns all of my opponent's monsters in the Extra Monster Zones to the Deck?",
    "question": "My opponent's Knightmare Mermaid and Knightmare Unicorn are in the Extra Monster Zones, in an Extra Link with Knightmare Phoenix, Knightmare Goblin, and Knightmare Cerberus in my opponent's Main Monster Zones. If I activate Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast and there are 3 or more Spell Cards in my Graveyard, how do I apply the part of the effect that returns all of my opponent's monsters in the Extra Monster Zones to the Deck?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, if the effect of Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast resolves and your opponent has 2 monsters in the Extra Monster Zones by forming an Extra Link, both of your opponent's monsters in the Extra Monster Zones are returned. (Knightmare Mermaid and Knightmare Unicorn return to your opponent's Extra Deck.)",
    "llm_answer": "If you activate Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast and there are 3 or more Spell Cards in your Graveyard:\n\n1. **Send Cards to the Graveyard**: Both players will send the top 2 cards of their Decks to the Graveyard.\n\n2. **Condition for Additional Effect**: If at least one card was sent to the Graveyard by this effect, and you have 3 or more Spell Cards in your Graveyard, you can then apply the additional effect of Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast.\n\n3. **Shuffling Monsters Back into the Deck**: Since the Knightmare Mermaid and Knightmare Unicorn are in the Extra Monster Zones, and they are part of an Extra Link with other Knightmare monsters in your opponent's Main Monster Zones, you can shuffle **all** of your opponent's monsters from the Extra Monster Zones back into the Deck. This includes both Knightmare Mermaid and Knightmare Unicorn.\n\n**Explanation**: The text of Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast specifies \"you can shuffle all your opponent's monsters from the **Extra Monster Zones** into the Deck\" if the conditions are met. The presence of the Extra Link does not change this specific targeting; it only applies to monsters in the Extra Monster Zones. Therefore, you will only return Knightmare Mermaid and Knightmare Unicorn to the Deck. \n\nThe scenario resolves with your opponent's Knightmare Mermaid and Knightmare Unicorn being returned to the Deck, while the Knightmare monsters in the Main Monster Zones (Knightmare Phoenix, Knightmare Goblin, and Knightmare Cerberus) remain on the field."
