    "question": "If a Spell and Trap Card treated as a Monster Card by the effect of Magical Hats is destroyed in battle, can the effect of First-Aid Squad in the Graveyard be activated?",
    "answer": "Since the Spell and Trap Cards Special Summoned as Monster Cards by the effect of Magical Hats are treated as Normal Monsters, if they are destroyed by battle, the effect of First-Aid Squad in the Graveyard can be activated.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can activate the effect of \"First-Aid Squad\" in the Graveyard if a Spell or Trap Card treated as a Monster Card by \"Magical Hats\" is destroyed by battle. \n\n**Reasoning:** \n- \"Magical Hats\" treats Spell and Trap Cards as Normal Monsters when they are Special Summoned.\n- \"First-Aid Squad\" can target a Normal Monster in the Graveyard, and since the Spell or Trap Card is treated as a Normal Monster, it meets the condition to be targeted.\n\n**Resolution:**\n- You can activate the effect of \"First-Aid Squad\" from the Graveyard, targeting the destroyed Spell or Trap Card treated as a Normal Monster to add it to your hand."
