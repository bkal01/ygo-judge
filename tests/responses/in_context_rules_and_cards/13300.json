    "question": "Elemental HERO Nova Master attacked an opponent's face-down Defense Position Man-Eater Bug and destroyed it in battle.\n\nAfter that Damage Calculation, if the effect of Man-Eater Bug activates and destroys Elemental HERO Nova Master, does the effect of Elemental HERO Nova Master activate?",
    "answer": "The effect of Elemental HERO Nova Master activates at the End of the Damage Step.\n\nIf Elemental HERO Nova Master is destroyed by the effect of Man-Eater Bug after Damage Calculation, the effect of that Elemental HERO Nova Master does not activate.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, the effect of Elemental HERO Nova Master activates. Since Elemental HERO Nova Master destroyed Man-Eater Bug by battle, its effect that says \"If this card destroys an opponent's monster by battle: Draw 1 card.\" activates and resolves **before** Man-Eater Bug's Flip Effect. The Flip Effect of Man-Eater Bug, which targets and destroys a monster on the field, resolves after Elemental HERO Nova Master's effect has already activated. Thus, the turn player will draw 1 card first."
