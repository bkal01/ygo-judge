    "question": "I activate the effect of Gullveig of the Nordic Ascendant, banishing Alviss of the Nordic Alfar from my hand, and Special Summoning Ljosalf of the Nordic Alfar from my Deck. At this time, if I activate the first effect of Alviss of the Nordic Alfar, but my opponent chains Macro Cosmos, what happens?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, the effect of Alviss of the Nordic Alfar resolves while the effect of Macro Cosmos is applying. In that case, the \"Nordic\" monster on your field and the 2 from your Deck that would be sent to the Graveyard are all banished instead, so you cannot Special Summon an \"Aesir\" monster from your Extra Deck.",
    "llm_answer": "The effect of Alviss of the Nordic Alfar will not resolve. Since Macro Cosmos banishes cards that would be sent to the Graveyard, and Alviss' effect requires sending \"Nordic\" monsters to the Graveyard, this action cannot be performed under the effect of Macro Cosmos. As a result, the effect of Alviss does not resolve properly."
