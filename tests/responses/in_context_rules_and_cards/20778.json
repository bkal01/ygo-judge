    "question": "While the effect of Macro Cosmos is applying, can a Link Summon be performed?",
    "answer": "Yes, it can. In that case, the monsters used as Link Materials are banished by the effect of Macro Cosmos instead of sent to the Graveyard, but the Link Monster is Special Summoned normally.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can perform a Link Summon while Macro Cosmos is active. The materials used for the Link Summon would be banished instead of being sent to the Graveyard. However, since the materials are still sent to the Graveyard as part of the Link Summon procedure, the Link Summon itself can still be performed, and the Link Monster would be placed in the Extra Monster Zone or a Main Monster Zone pointed by a Link Arrow."
