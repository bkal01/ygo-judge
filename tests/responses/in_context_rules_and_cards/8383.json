    "question": "My opponent activated Skill Drain, and the effects of a Ghostrick Alucard in my Monster Zone are negated. If my opponent declares an attack on a face-down Defense Position monster, but I activate Mystical Space Typhoon during the Battle Step and destroy Skill Drain, what happens to the attack?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, the effect of Skill Drain is negating the effect of Ghostrick Alucard which prevents your opponent from targeting other \"Ghostrick\" monsters or any face-down Defense Position monsters for attacks. If an attack is declared targeting a face-down Defense Position monster, and Skill Drain is subsequently destroyed during the Battle Step, the attack continues to the Damage Step.\n\n(The effect of Ghostrick Alucard prevents other \"Ghostrick\" monsters and face-down Defense Position monsters from being targeted for attacks, but since the attack target was already selected when the attack was declared, the attack continues normally and no replay occurs.)",
    "llm_answer": "If your opponent declares an attack on a face-down Defense Position monster while **Skill Drain** is active, the effects of your **Ghostrick Alucard** are negated, meaning the protection it provides to face-down Defense Position monsters does not apply.\n\nHere is what happens:\n\n1. **Skill Drain** is active, negating the effects of your **Ghostrick Alucard**.\n2. Your opponent declares an attack on a face-down Defense Position monster.\n3. You activate **Mystical Space Typhoon** targeting **Skill Drain** during the Battle Step and destroy **Skill Drain**.\n\nOnce **Skill Drain** is destroyed, **Ghostrick Alucard's** effects are no longer negated. However:\n\n- **Ghostrick Alucard's** effect that prevents your opponent from targeting face-down Defense Position monsters for attacks is now active again. \n\n**Therefore, the attack declared by your opponent on the face-down Defense Position monster will not proceed as the target is now protected by Ghostrick Alucard's effect.** \n\nA replay will occur, and your opponent will have to choose a new attack target or end the Battle Phase if no valid target exists."
