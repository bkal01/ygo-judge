    "question": "Can the effect of Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin be activated by targeting a Ritual Beast Tamer Wen if another Ritual Beast Tamer Wen was already Special Summoned that turn?",
    "answer": "The effect of Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin can only be activated by targeting a \"Ritual Beast\" monster that has not yet been Special Summoned that turn. (If you do not have 2 banished \"Ritual Beast\" monsters that have not been Special Summoned that turn, you cannot activate the effect of Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin.)",
    "llm_answer": "No, the effect of **Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin** cannot be activated by targeting a **Ritual Beast Tamer Wen** if another **Ritual Beast Tamer Wen** was already Special Summoned that turn. The effect text of **Ritual Beast Tamer Wen** specifies that you can only Special Summon \"Ritual Beast Tamer Wen(s)\" once per turn. \n\n**Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin**'s effect to return itself to the Extra Deck and Special Summon two of your banished monsters would still trigger the \"once per turn\" restriction on **Ritual Beast Tamer Wen**. Therefore, if one **Ritual Beast Tamer Wen** has already been Special Summoned, you cannot Special Summon another **Ritual Beast Tamer Wen** using **Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin**'s effect during the same turn.\n\nThe scenario will resolve as follows:\n\n- **Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin** returns to the Extra Deck.\n- You cannot target a second **Ritual Beast Tamer Wen** for Special Summoning because of the \"once per turn\" restriction on **Ritual Beast Tamer Wen**."
