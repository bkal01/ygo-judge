    "question": "A face-up P.M. Captor is the only monster on my field. In this situation, can I activate the second effect of Vampire's Desire?",
    "answer": "Even if the Pendulum Monster P.M. Captor is the only monster on your field, you can activate the second effect of Vampire's Desire. In that case, P.M. Captor is added face-up to the Extra Deck instead of sent to the Graveyard, and the targeted \"Vampire\" monster is not Special Summoned.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can activate the second effect of \"Vampire's Desire\" in this scenario. The second effect allows you to target a \"Vampire\" monster in your Graveyard, send a monster you control to the Graveyard, and then Special Summon the targeted \"Vampire\" monster. Since P.M. Captor is a Zombie-Type monster and \"Vampire\" monsters are also Zombies, you can send P.M. Captor to the Graveyard to meet the condition for the effect of \"Vampire's Desire\". \n\n**Resolution:** You can activate the second effect of \"Vampire's Desire,\" sending your face-up P.M. Captor to the Graveyard, and then Special Summon the targeted \"Vampire\" monster from your Graveyard."
