    "question": "Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands is in my Graveyard. In this situation, a Herald of the Arc Light is Tributed to activate its own effect. Afterward, if I want to activate the second effect of Vennu, Bright Bird of Divinity, do I have to target the Herald of the Arc Light that was Tributed?",
    "answer": "The second effect of Vennu, Bright Bird of Divinity can be activated when another monster on your side of the field/hand is Tributed, but it can target any monster in your Graveyard, not just the one that was Tributed. Therefore, in this scenario, the effect of Vennu, Bright Bird of Divinity can target the Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands that was already in your Graveyard.",
    "llm_answer": "No, you do not have to target the Herald of the Arc Light that was Tributed to activate the second effect of Vennu, Bright Bird of Divinity. **The second effect of Vennu, Bright Bird of Divinity can target any monster in your Graveyard**, not just the monster that was Tributed.\n\n**Resolution**: You can target any monster in your Graveyard to add to your hand when you activate the second effect of Vennu, Bright Bird of Divinity."
