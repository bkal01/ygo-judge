    "question": "While Anti-Spell Fragrance is applying, if Masked Beast Des Gardius is sent from the field to the Graveyard, will its effect activate?",
    "answer": "Equipping The Mask of Remnants from the Deck by the effect of Masked Beast Des Gardius is not considered activating a Spell Card. Therefore, even while Anti-Spell Fragrance is applying, the effect of Masked Beast Des Gardius will activate as usual, and equip The Mask of Remnants to the targeted monster.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, the effect of **Masked Beast Des Gardius** will activate.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- **Anti-Spell Fragrance** only affects Spell Cards, requiring them to be Set before activation and delaying their activation until the next turn. It does not interfere with the activation of monster effects.\n- The effect of **Masked Beast Des Gardius** triggers when it is sent from the field to the Graveyard, which is an inherent monster effect. Since this effect does not involve activating a Spell Card, **Anti-Spell Fragrance** does not prevent it from activating.\n\n**Resolution:** When Masked Beast Des Gardius is sent from the field to the Graveyard, its effect activates, targeting a face-up monster your opponent controls and equipping \"The Mask of Remnants\" from your Deck to it."
