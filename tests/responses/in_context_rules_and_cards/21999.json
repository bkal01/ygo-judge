    "question": "I activate Galaxy Trance, targeting a Photon Crusher in my Graveyard. If my opponent chains the effect of D.D. Crow and banishes that Photon Crusher from the Graveyard, how does the effect of Galaxy Trance resolve?",
    "answer": "If the targeted \"Photon\" monster is not in your Graveyard when the effect of Galaxy Trance resolves, the effect is not applied. (No monster is Special Summoned from the Deck either.)",
    "llm_answer": "The effect of **Galaxy Trance** will not resolve properly because the targeted **Photon Crusher** was banished by **D.D. Crow** before **Galaxy Trance** could resolve. Since the target is no longer in the Graveyard, **Galaxy Trance** cannot Special Summon the targeted **Photon Crusher** or any **Galaxy** monster from the Deck. \n\n**Resolution:** Galaxy Trance's effect does not resolve and no monsters are Special Summoned."
