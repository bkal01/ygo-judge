    "question": "If I have all pieces of Exodia the Forbidden One in my hand, can I choose not to reveal this?",
    "answer": "If all five pieces of Exodia the Forbidden One are in your hand, you must declare that you have them and win the Duel. You cannot choose not to do this.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can choose not to reveal Exodia the Forbidden One if you have all five pieces in your hand. \n\nThe card text for **Exodia the Forbidden One** states:\n\n- **Effect Text**: \"If you have 'Right Leg of the Forbidden One', 'Left Leg of the Forbidden One', 'Right Arm of the Forbidden One' and 'Left Arm of the Forbidden One' in addition to this card in your hand, **you win the Duel**.\"\n\nThis text is not an effect that can be activated or negated; it's a **special victory condition**. Since it is not an effect, it does not require activation or any form of public declaration. Therefore, you can choose not to reveal the Exodia pieces and simply continue the game as normal until you meet the victory condition or decide to reveal them. \n\nKeep in mind that if you do not reveal Exodia and meet the victory condition during the resolution of an effect or chain where the pieces are drawn or returned to your hand, you can declare victory **after** the resolution of the chain, assuming all pieces are still in your hand at that time."
