    "question": "If my F.A. Shining Star GT battles an opponent's monster, can I activate the second effect of F.A. Dead Heat before damage calculation?",
    "answer": "F.A. Shining Star GT is a Link Monster, and has no Level. You cannot activate the second effect of F.A. Dead Heat when F.A. Shining Star GT battles.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can activate the second effect of **F.A. Dead Heat** before damage calculation if **F.A. Shining Star GT** battles an opponent's monster. \n\nThe relevant rules state:\n\n- **F.A. Dead Heat** is a Continuous Trap Card, which can activate its effects during damage calculation.\n- **F.A. Shining Star GT**'s effect that says \"Neither player takes any battle damage from attacks involving this card\" does not prevent the use of effects that activate during damage calculation.\n- Effects that activate during damage calculation can be used before damage calculation occurs.\n\nSince **F.A. Dead Heat** has an effect that activates before damage calculation during the battle involving an **F.A.** monster, you can use this effect when **F.A. Shining Star GT** battles an opponent's monster.\n\n**Resolution:** You can activate the second effect of **F.A. Dead Heat** before damage calculation when **F.A. Shining Star GT** battles an opponent's monster, following the rules for activating Continuous Trap effects during the Damage Step."
