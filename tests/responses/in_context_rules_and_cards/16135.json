    "question": "When applying the effect of Legion the Fiend Jester that allows me to Tribute Summon an additional Spellcaster-Type monster, can I Tribute a Double Coston and treat it as 2 Tributes to Tribute Summon a Dark Magician?",
    "answer": "If you want to apply the effect of Legion the Fiend Jester, you must Tribute Summon. In this scenario, if you apply the effect of Double Coston and treat it as 2 Tributes, you can Tribute Double Coston for the Tribute Summon of Dark Magician.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can Tribute Double Coston and treat it as 2 Tributes to Tribute Summon a Dark Magician during the Main Phase using the effect of Legion the Fiend Jester. \n\n**Explanation:** Double Coston has an effect that allows it to be treated as 2 Tributes for the Tribute Summon of a DARK monster. Since Dark Magician is a DARK monster, you can indeed use Double Coston as the required 2 Tributes to perform the Tribute Summon. This action is consistent with the rules for Tribute Summoning Level 7 or higher monsters, which require 2 Tributes. \n\n**Resolution:** You Tribute Summon Dark Magician by Tributing Double Coston, fulfilling the requirement for the Tribute Summon, and place Dark Magician on the field in face-up Attack Position."
