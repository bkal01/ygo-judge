    "question": "I activate Water of Life and Special Summon a Sangan from my Graveyard. During this turn, if I Tribute that Sangan for a Tribute Summon, can I activate its effect?",
    "answer": "Water of Life prevents you from activating monster effects for the rest of the turn after it resolves, except the effects of the Special Summoned monster that activate on the field. Therefore, in this scenario, the effect of Sangan does not activate when it is sent to the Graveyard after being Special Summoned by the effect of Water of Life.",
    "llm_answer": "No, you cannot activate Sangan's effect if you Tribute it for a Tribute Summon during the same turn you activated Water of Life.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- **Water of Life's Effect:** This card has a clause that states \"for the rest of this turn after this card resolves, you cannot activate monster effects, except the effects of that Special Summoned monster on the field.\" This means that after Water of Life resolves, only the effects of the monster Special Summoned by Water of Life can be activated.\n- **Sangan's Effect:** Sangan's effect activates when it is sent from the field to the Graveyard. Since Water of Life restricts the activation of monster effects to only the effects of the Special Summoned monster, once Sangan is tributed and sent to the Graveyard, its effect cannot be activated.\n\n**Resolution:** \n- If you Special Summon Sangan with Water of Life and then Tribute it for a Tribute Summon, Sangan's effect will not trigger because the restriction from Water of Life prevents any other monster effects from being activated."
