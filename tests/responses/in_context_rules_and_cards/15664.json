    "question": "The effect of a Superheavy Samurai Blowtorch in the hand was activated, targeting a Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler.\n\nIf the effect of Enemy Controller to switch control or Compulsory Evacuation Device are activated so that Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler is no longer on your side of the field, how does this resolve?",
    "answer": "If at the time of the resolution of the effect of Superheavy Samurai Blowtorch the targeted Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler has been returned to the hand by the effect of Compulsory Evacuation Device or has switched control by the effect of Enemy Controller, so that it cannot be targeted for an attack, the effect of Superheavy Samurai Blowtorch is not applied.",
    "llm_answer": "If **Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler** is no longer on your side of the field due to the effect of **Enemy Controller** or **Compulsory Evacuation Device** when **Superheavy Samurai Blowtorch**'s effect resolves:\n\n- **Superheavy Samurai Blowtorch**'s effect will not apply to **Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler** because the target is no longer on your side of the field. The effect of **Superheavy Samurai Blowtorch** requires the targeted monster to be on your side of the field to change the attack target to it.\n\n**Resolution**: The attack continues with its original target, as **Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler** is not available to be redirected."
