    "question": "My opponent activates Icarus Attack, targeting Megalosmasher X and Lost World on my field. At this time, can I apply the effect of Lost World that destroys Dinosaur-Type monsters in my hand or Deck instead?",
    "answer": "Even if Lost World and a Normal Monster on the field would be destroyed at the same time, as in this scenario, you can apply the effect of Lost World that destroys Dinosaur-Type monsters in your hand or Deck instead. (In this scenario, Lost World itself is destroyed by the effect of Icarus Attack, but Megalosmasher X is not destroyed, and you destroy 1 Dinosaur-Type monster in your hand or Deck instead.)",
    "llm_answer": "No, you cannot apply the effect of Lost World in this situation. Here's why:\n\n- **Icarus Attack** requires a cost to be paid before the effect resolves, which is Tributing a Winged Beast monster. After the cost is paid, the effect of **Icarus Attack** targets two cards on the field to destroy them.\n\n- **Lost World** has an effect that can replace the destruction of Normal Monsters with Dinosaur monsters from your hand or Deck. However, this effect of **Lost World** is a replacement effect that triggers when a Normal Monster \"would be destroyed by battle or card effect.\"\n\n- The key here is the timing of the effects. **Icarus Attack** does not specify that it destroys monsters by a card effect at the time of its activation; it simply destroys cards after its cost is paid. Therefore, **Lost World**'s replacement effect does not apply because **Icarus Attack**'s destruction is not explicitly tied to a \"card effect\" at the moment of activation.\n\n**Resolution**: Since **Icarus Attack**'s destruction effect is not treated as a card effect that would trigger **Lost World**'s replacement effect, your opponent's **Icarus Attack** will successfully destroy both **Megalosmasher X** and **Lost World**."
