    "question": "If I Link Summon Knightmare Goblin to the Extra Monster Zone, can I activate its effect that allows me to perform an additional Normal Summon that turn?",
    "answer": "Even if you Link Summon Knightmare Goblin to the Extra Monster Zone, you can activate its effect that allows you to perform an additional Normal Summon that turn to a Zone that it points to. While Knightmare Goblin is in the Extra Monster Zone, you cannot perform that additional Normal Summon since it does not point to any Main Monster Zones. However, if you activate the effect of a card such as Trancefamiliar and move Knightmare Goblin to one of your Main Monster Zones, you will then be able to perform the additional Normal Summon if Knightmare Goblin points to another Main Monster Zone.",
    "llm_answer": "**Answer:** Yes, you can activate the effect of **Knightmare Goblin** that allows you to perform an additional Normal Summon during the turn you Link Summon it.\n\n**Reasoning:** The card's effect specifies that if it is Link Summoned during your turn, you can discard 1 card to activate its effect. This effect includes drawing a card if **Knightmare Goblin** was co-linked when the effect was activated, and granting an additional Normal Summon during your Main Phase that turn. Since you can Link Summon **Knightmare Goblin** to the Extra Monster Zone, and the condition for activating its effect (Link Summoning during your turn) is met, you are able to discard a card to activate this effect.\n\n**Resolution:** You discard 1 card, and if **Knightmare Goblin** is co-linked, you draw a card. Then, during your Main Phase, you can perform an additional Normal Summon to a zone **Knightmare Goblin** points to."
