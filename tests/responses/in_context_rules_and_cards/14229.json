    "question": "When you target a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link Monster\u00a0with\u00a0Monster Reincarnation, how does the effect resolve if\u00a0Stellarknight Constellar Diamond that has Xyz Material attached is face-up on the field?",
    "answer": "Monster Reincarnation's effect is an effect that returns a monster from the Graveyard to the hand, so even if you target a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link Monster, the effect of\u00a0Stellarknight Constellar Diamond will be applied and the targeted monster will be banished instead.",
    "llm_answer": "The effect of **Monster Reincarnation** resolves normally. Since **Stellarknight Constellar Diamond**'s effect only prevents cards from being sent from the Deck to the Graveyard and returning cards from the Graveyard to the hand from being banished, it does not interfere with the effect of **Monster Reincarnation** which targets a monster in your Graveyard to add it to your hand. \n\n**Stellarknight Constellar Diamond** does not affect cards already in the Graveyard or the act of adding cards from the Graveyard to the hand, so the targeted Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link Monster can be added to your hand by **Monster Reincarnation** without any issues."
