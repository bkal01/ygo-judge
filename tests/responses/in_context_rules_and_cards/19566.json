    "question": "A Legendary Ocean is face-up in my Field Zone. In this situation, I activate the first effect of <<11976>> Jr. by targeting a Graydle Dragon in my Graveyard. In this case, if I want to Special Summon an Aqua-Type monster from my hand, what Level monster can I Special Summon?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, the Graydle Dragon that is Special Summoned from the Graveyard is Level 8, but its Level is reduced to 7 by the effect of A Legendary Ocean. In this case, if you want to Special Summon an Aqua-Type monster from your hand with the same Level, you will Special Summon a Level 7 monster. Note that since the effect of A Legendary Ocean also reduces the Levels of WATER monsters in your hand by 1, you could Special Summon an Aqua-Type WATER monster such as Mobius the Mega Monarch treated as Level 7 in this case.",
    "llm_answer": "You can Special Summon an Aqua-Type monster with Level **7 or lower** from your hand. This is because **A Legendary Ocean** reduces the Level of all WATER monsters in both players' hands and on the field by 1. Since **Graydle Dragon** is a Level 8 monster, its Level is effectively reduced to 7 when in the Graveyard due to **A Legendary Ocean**, allowing you to target and Special Summon an Aqua-Type monster of Level 7 or lower."
