    "title": "What happens to a monster's attack if Skill Drain, which is negating the effects of Ghostrick Alucard, is destroyed during the Battle Step?",
    "question": "My opponent activated Skill Drain, and the effects of a Ghostrick Alucard in my Monster Zone are negated. If my opponent declares an attack on a face-down Defense Position monster, but I activate Mystical Space Typhoon during the Battle Step and destroy Skill Drain, what happens to the attack?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, the effect of Skill Drain is negating the effect of Ghostrick Alucard which prevents your opponent from targeting other \"Ghostrick\" monsters or any face-down Defense Position monsters for attacks. If an attack is declared targeting a face-down Defense Position monster, and Skill Drain is subsequently destroyed during the Battle Step, the attack continues to the Damage Step.\n\n(The effect of Ghostrick Alucard prevents other \"Ghostrick\" monsters and face-down Defense Position monsters from being targeted for attacks, but since the attack target was already selected when the attack was declared, the attack continues normally and no replay occurs.)",
    "llm_answer": "The attack will now be illegal. Since Ghostrick Alucard's effect that prevents attacks on face-down Defense Position monsters is no longer negated after Skill Drain is destroyed, the attack cannot continue. The Battle Phase will proceed to the next step, and your opponent must choose a different attack target or end their Battle Phase."
