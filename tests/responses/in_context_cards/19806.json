    "question": "I activated 2 copies of Abyss Script - Fire Dragon's Lair, each targeting my Abyss Actor - Evil Heel. This turn, if Abyss Actor - Evil Heel destroys an opponent's monster by battle, will the effects of each Abyss Script - Fire Dragon's Lair apply?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, if a monster that was targeted with 2 different copies of Abyss Script - Fire Dragon's Lair destroys an opponent's monster by battle this turn, the effect of each copy is applied. (As a result, your opponent banishes a total of 6 monsters from their Extra Deck.)",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, both effects will apply. Abyss Actor - Evil Heel will trigger both copies of Abyss Script - Fire Dragon's Lair when it destroys an opponent's monster by battle, resulting in your opponent banishing a total of 6 monsters from their Extra Deck."
