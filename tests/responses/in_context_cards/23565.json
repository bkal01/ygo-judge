    "question": "Can the effect of Firewall Dragon Darkfluid - Neo Tempest Terahertz be activated while Gozen Match is applying?",
    "answer": "Yes, it can.\n\nAfter resolving the effect of Firewall Dragon Darkfluid - Neo Tempest Terahertz, if it is treated as 2 or more different Attributes, it must be sent to the Graveyard immediately.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, the effect of Firewall Dragon Darkfluid - Neo Tempest Terahertz can be activated while Gozen Match is applying. The effect changes the Attribute of the card, but it does not conflict with Gozen Match's restriction on controlling multiple Attributes since the change is temporary and does not violate the rule of having only one Attribute on the field.\n\n**Resolution:** The player can send a Cyberse monster from their Deck or Extra Deck to the GY, and Firewall Dragon Darkfluid - Neo Tempest Terahertz will gain the Attribute of that monster, also gaining 2500 ATK."
