    "question": "My Salamangreat Heatleo is in the Extra Monster Zone. In this situation, when I activate the effect of a Salamangreat Jack Jaguar in my Graveyard, targeting a Salamangreat Falco in my Graveyard, what happens if my opponent chains Compulsory Evacuation Device and returns Salamangreat Heatleo to the Extra Deck?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, since you no longer have a \"Salamangreat\" Link Monster on your field, you still apply the part of the effect that returns Salamangreat Falco to the Deck, but you cannot Special Summon Salamangreat Jack Jaguar to a zone a \"Salamangreat\" Link Monster points to, and it remains in your Graveyard.",
    "llm_answer": "The effect of **Salamangreat Jack Jaguar** will resolve as normal, Special Summoning **Salamangreat Jack Jaguar** to a Main Monster Zone. The Special Summon does not require **Salamangreat Heatleo** to be on the field, only that you control a \"Salamangreat\" Link Monster at the time of activation. Thus, even if **Salamangreat Heatleo** is returned to the Extra Deck, **Jack Jaguar** can still be Special Summoned."
