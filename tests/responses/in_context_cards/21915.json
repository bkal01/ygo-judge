    "question": "Skill Drain is face-up in my opponent's Spell & Trap Zone, and its effect that negates the effects of face-up monsters on the field is applying. In this situation, if a Special Summoned Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon leaves the field, will it be placed on the bottom of the Deck?",
    "answer": "Even if the effects of Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon are negated by Skill Drain, the effect that places it on the bottom of the Deck will be applied when it leaves the field.",
    "llm_answer": "No, Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon will not be placed on the bottom of the Deck. **Skill Drain** negates the effects of monsters while they are face-up on the field, including Chaos Emperor's effect that would return it to the bottom of the Deck when it leaves the field. \n\n**Resolution**: Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon will be sent to the Graveyard instead."
