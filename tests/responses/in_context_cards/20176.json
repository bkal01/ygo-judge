    "question": "If my Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon attacks my opponent's Flower Cardian Lightflare, and Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon is destroyed by battle, is it possible to activate the effect of Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon that banishes the opponent's battling monster at the end of the Damage Step?",
    "answer": "Even in this scenario, since Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon attacked an opponent's monster, but that monster was not destroyed by battle, you can activate its effect. In this case, since Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates in the Graveyard. Although the effect of Flower Cardian Lightflare negates the effects of monsters that battle \"Flower Cardian\" monsters, the effect of Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon that activates in the Graveyard is not negated.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, the effect of Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon can still be activated at the end of the Damage Step, even if Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon is destroyed by battle. This is because the effect triggers at the end of the Damage Step, regardless of whether Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon is still on the field or not. \n\n**Resolution:** Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon's effect will activate at the end of the Damage Step, banishing Flower Cardian Lightflare."
