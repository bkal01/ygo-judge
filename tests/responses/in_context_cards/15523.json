    "question": "Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli is Fusion Summoned by Brilliant Fusion. Then, if the second effect of Brilliant Fusion is activated, but Forbidden Lance is chained, making Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli unaffected by Spell effects, what does its ATK and DEF become? Also, if the effect of Brilliant Fusion has already been applied, but Forbidden Lance is then activated, making Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli unaffected by Spell effects, what does its ATK and DEF become?",
    "answer": "When the effect of Brilliant Fusion resolves, if the Fusion Monster is unaffected by Spell effects, it does not gain ATK and DEF from the effect of Brilliant Fusion. Also, if the effect of Brilliant Fusion has already been applied, and the Fusion Monster then becomes unaffected by Spell effects, the ATK and DEF gained by the effect continues to apply. (From that value, the effect of Forbidden Lance will make the monster lose 800 ATK.)",
    "llm_answer": "If **Brilliant Fusion**'s second effect is activated but **Forbidden Lance** is chained, **Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli**'s ATK and DEF remain at 0. This is because **Forbidden Lance** makes the monster unaffected by Spell effects, including the ATK/DEF boost from **Brilliant Fusion**.\n\nIf **Brilliant Fusion**'s effect has already been applied, giving **Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli** its original ATK and DEF, and then **Forbidden Lance** is activated, **Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli**'s ATK and DEF will revert to 0. **Forbidden Lance**'s effect only prevents future Spell effects from affecting the monster, but does not undo previously applied effects. Therefore, **Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli** will have 0 ATK and DEF for the rest of the turn."
