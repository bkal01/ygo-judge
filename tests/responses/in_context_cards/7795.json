    "question": "An Ally of Justice Nullfier battles a White Duston. After damage calculation, will the effect of Ally of Justice Nullfier activate?",
    "answer": "White Duston is a LIGHT Normal Monster, but even in this case, since Ally of Justice Nullfier battled a LIGHT monster, its effect will activate after damage calculation. A Chain Link will be created, but since White Duston is a Normal Monster, no effect is negated.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, the effect of **Ally of Justice Nullfier** will activate. Since **White Duston** is a LIGHT monster, **Nullfier**'s effect will negate the effects of **White Duston**, even though **White Duston** has no effects. The scenario resolves with **Nullfier** successfully negating any potential effects **White Duston** might have had."
