    "question": "When Special Summoning Performapal Kuribohble with its own effect, can I Special Summon it in Defense Position?",
    "answer": "When Special Summoning Performapal Kuribohble with its own effect, you can Special Summon it in face-up Defense Position instead of face-up Attack Position. It becomes the new attack target and damage calculation is conducted as usual. If your opponent attacked with a monster equipped with Fairy Meteor Crush and would inflict piercing battle damage, the effect of Performapal Kuribohble makes you gain Life Points instead.",
    "llm_answer": "No, you cannot Special Summon Performapal Kuribohble in Defense Position with its own effect. Its effect only allows it to be Special Summoned from your hand to change the attack target, implying it must be summoned in Attack Position. \n\n**Resolution**: Performapal Kuribohble will be Special Summoned in Attack Position."
