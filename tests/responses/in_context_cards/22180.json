    "question": "If Cyberse Quantum Dragon battles an opponent's Monster Token, can its effect be activated at the start of the Damage Step?",
    "answer": "You can activate the effect of Cyberse Quantum Dragon at the start of the Damage Step when it battles an opponent's Monster Token. In that case, the Token disappears instead of returning to the hand, but Cyberse Quantum Dragon can still make a second attack.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, Cyberse Quantum Dragon's effect can be activated at the start of the Damage Step when it battles an opponent's Monster Token. Tokens can be returned to the hand, as they are considered monsters on the field. The scenario will resolve with the Monster Token being returned to the hand, and Cyberse Quantum Dragon will then be able to make a second attack."
