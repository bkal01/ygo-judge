    "title": "Can the effect of Fabled Andwraith summon my opponent's Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring that was discarded to activate its effect?",
    "question": "While I control a Fabled Andwraith, I activate Foolish Burial. In response, my opponent activates the effect of Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring by discarding it.\n\nIn this case, can I use the effect of Fabled Andwraith to Special Summon that Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring with its effects negated?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can.\n\nThe Trigger Effect of Fabled Andwraith in question can be activated in a new Chain after resolving the current Chain where Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring negated the effect of Foolish Burial. (The effect is not activated immediately when the monster is sent to the Graveyard.)\n\nIn the given situation, the effect of Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring activated as Chain Link 2 negates the effect of Foolish Burial activated as Chain Link 1. Then, after the Chain has resolved, the effect of Fabled Andwraith can be activated as Chain Link 1 in a new Chain.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can use the effect of Fabled Andwraith to Special Summon the Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring that was discarded to activate its effect. This is because the card was sent from your opponent's hand to the GY, triggering Fabled Andwraith's effect. \n\n**Resolution:** You will Special Summon Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring with its effects negated."
