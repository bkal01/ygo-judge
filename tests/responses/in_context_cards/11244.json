    "question": "When a face-up Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark is destroyed by a card effect and sent to the Graveyard, I activate the last effect of Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy that increases the ATK of an Xyz Monster on the field. If The Transmigration Prophecy is chained, so that Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark is no longer in the Graveyard, how does the effect of Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy resolve?",
    "answer": "In this case, even if Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark is no longer in your Graveyard when the effect of Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy resolves, the targeted monster on the field still gains the ATK normally.",
    "llm_answer": "The effect of **Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy** will still resolve successfully. Since **Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark** was destroyed by a card effect and sent to the Graveyard, the condition for Number 38's effect to activate is met. The Transmigration Prophecy can shuffle **Number 37** back into the deck, but it does not prevent the resolution of **Number 38**'s effect, which only requires the destruction of another Xyz Monster to happen, not the presence of **Number 37** in the Graveyard. \n\n**Resolution**: Number 38's effect will successfully increase the ATK of a face-up Xyz Monster on the field by 2600 (the original ATK of **Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark**)."
