    "question": "Elemental HERO Nova Master attacked an opponent's face-down Defense Position Man-Eater Bug and destroyed it in battle.\n\nAfter that Damage Calculation, if the effect of Man-Eater Bug activates and destroys Elemental HERO Nova Master, does the effect of Elemental HERO Nova Master activate?",
    "answer": "The effect of Elemental HERO Nova Master activates at the End of the Damage Step.\n\nIf Elemental HERO Nova Master is destroyed by the effect of Man-Eater Bug after Damage Calculation, the effect of that Elemental HERO Nova Master does not activate.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, the effect of Elemental HERO Nova Master will activate. It triggers when it destroys an opponent's monster by battle, which happens before Man-Eater Bug's effect can destroy Nova Master. **The scenario resolves with Elemental HERO Nova Master's effect activating and allowing its controller to draw a card.**"
