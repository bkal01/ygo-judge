    "question": "I activated the effect of\u00a0Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan and Special Summoned itself. Can I later activate\u00a0Reasoning this turn?",
    "answer": "You can still activate\u00a0Reasoning in this situation.\n\nAfter you used the effect of\u00a0Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan that Special Summons itself, you\u00a0cannot Special Summon monsters for the rest of this\u00a0turn, except\u00a0Level/Rank\u00a03 or higher monsters. If you excavate a Level 2 or lower monster with the effect of\u00a0Reasoning in this situation, it cannot be Special Summoned and it will be sent to the Graveyard with the other excavated cards.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can activate Reasoning this turn. The restriction from Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan's effect only applies to Special Summons, not to activating Spell cards like Reasoning. **Resolution:** You can activate Reasoning and proceed with its effect normally."
