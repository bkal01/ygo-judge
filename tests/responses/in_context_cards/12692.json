    "question": "A face-up P.M. Captor is the only monster on my field. In this situation, can I activate the second effect of Vampire's Desire?",
    "answer": "Even if the Pendulum Monster P.M. Captor is the only monster on your field, you can activate the second effect of Vampire's Desire. In that case, P.M. Captor is added face-up to the Extra Deck instead of sent to the Graveyard, and the targeted \"Vampire\" monster is not Special Summoned.",
    "llm_answer": "No, you cannot activate the second effect of **Vampire's Desire** because you must send a monster you control to the GY to Special Summon the targeted monster, and **P.M. Captor** is the only monster on your field. \n\n**Resolution**: The effect cannot be activated."
