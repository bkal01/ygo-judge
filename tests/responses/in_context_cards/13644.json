    "question": "While the effect of Planckton is applying, if a Rank 4 or higher monster I control becomes unaffected by Spell/Trap effects due to the effect of Forbidden Lance, can that monster attack?",
    "answer": "Yes it can, even if Planckton already resolved.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, the Rank 4 or higher monster can attack. Since Forbidden Lance makes the monster unaffected by other Spell/Trap effects, it will bypass the restriction from Planckton, allowing it to attack normally. The scenario will resolve with the monster being able to declare an attack."
