    "question": "I activate Galaxy Trance, targeting a Photon Crusher in my Graveyard. If my opponent chains the effect of D.D. Crow and banishes that Photon Crusher from the Graveyard, how does the effect of Galaxy Trance resolve?",
    "answer": "If the targeted \"Photon\" monster is not in your Graveyard when the effect of Galaxy Trance resolves, the effect is not applied. (No monster is Special Summoned from the Deck either.)",
    "llm_answer": "The effect of Galaxy Trance cannot resolve properly because the targeted Photon Crusher was banished by D.D. Crow's effect. Therefore, you will not be able to Special Summon any monsters, and you will still pay the 2000 LP cost. The scenario resolves with no monsters being summoned and the LP cost paid."
