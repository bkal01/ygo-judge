    "answer": "When performing a Fusion Summon using the effect of Gem-Knight Phantom Quartz, you can include Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and/or Link Monsters as materials. For example, if you Fusion Summon a Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli, which requires Gem-Knight Lapis and another \"Gem-Knight\" monster, you can use a Gem-Knight Lapis and a Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond in your Graveyard as materials. (Gem-Knight Lapis returns to the Deck, but Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond returns to the Extra Deck.)",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can include Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and/or Link Monsters in your Graveyard or that are banished as materials for the Fusion Summon. The card's effect specifies that any Fusion Materials listed on the Fusion Monster that are in your possession, including those that are banished or in the GY, can be shuffled back into your Deck to perform the Fusion Summon.\n**Resolution:** You can use those monsters as materials for the Fusion Summon."
