As a result, both Performapal Lebellman and Performapal Trampolynx are now Level 4. In this situation, if my opponent activates Skill Drain so that the effects of Performapal Lebellman are negated, what happens to my monsters' Levels?",
    "question": "The monster effect of Performapal Lebellman is activated by declaring Level 2, targeting my Performapal Trampolynx. As a result, both Performapal Lebellman and Performapal Trampolynx are now Level 4. In this situation, if my opponent activates Skill Drain so that the effects of Performapal Lebellman are negated, what happens to my monsters' Levels?",
    "answer": "After the monster effect of Performapal Lebellman has resolved, even if the effect of Skill Drain is applied, the Level of that Performapal Lebellman remains reduced, and the targeted monster's Level remains increased. (In this scenario, both Performapal Lebellman and Performapal Trampolynx remain Level 4. At the end of the turn, their Levels return to their original values normally.)",
    "llm_answer": "The Levels of Performapal Lebellman and Performapal Trampolynx will **stay at Level 4**. Skill Drain only negates the effects of monsters while they are face-up on the field, but it does not undo changes already applied by those effects. The scenario resolves with both monsters remaining at their modified Levels."
