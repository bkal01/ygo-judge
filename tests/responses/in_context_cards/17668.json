    "question": "If the opponent activates Enemy Controller in a chain to the activation of the effect of Super Quantal Mech Beast Magnaliger, Super Quantal Mech Beast Aeroboros, or Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse that attaches an Xyz Material to itself, so that control of Super Quantal Mech Beast Magnaliger or similar switches to the opponent, how does this resolve?",
    "answer": "Even in that case, the effect resolves normally.\n\n(A \"Super Quantum Mecha Pilot\" monster in the hand or face-up on your side of the field is attached to the monster that switched control to the opponent as an Xyz Material)",
    "llm_answer": "The Xyz Material attachment effect will still resolve successfully, even if control of the Super Quantal Mech Beast switches to the opponent due to Enemy Controller. The attachment effect is part of the same activation and will complete its resolution regardless of control change. Thus, the chosen \"Super Quantum\" monster will be attached to the Super Quantal Mech Beast as an Xyz Material."
