    "question": "If Ignoble Knight of Black Laundsallyn is targeted by the last effect of Lady of the Lake, but Raigeki Break is chained, targeting and destroying Ignoble Knight of Black Laundsallyn, how will the effect of Lady of the Lake resolve?",
    "answer": "The effect of Lady of the Lake cannot reduce the Level of Ignoble Knight of Black Laundsallyn by 1, so it is not Special Summoned.",
    "llm_answer": "**Answer:** Lady of the Lake will not Special Summon itself. If the targeted monster (Ignoble Knight of Black Laundsallyn) is destroyed or removed before the effect resolves, Lady of the Lake cannot Special Summon itself. \n\n**Resolution:** Lady of the Lake will stay in the Graveyard, and the Level 5 \"Noble Knight\" monster will remain at its current Level."
