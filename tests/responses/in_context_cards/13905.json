    "question": "Can the effect of Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin be activated by targeting a Ritual Beast Tamer Wen if another Ritual Beast Tamer Wen was already Special Summoned that turn?",
    "answer": "The effect of Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin can only be activated by targeting a \"Ritual Beast\" monster that has not yet been Special Summoned that turn. (If you do not have 2 banished \"Ritual Beast\" monsters that have not been Special Summoned that turn, you cannot activate the effect of Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin.)",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, the effect of Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin can be activated to target Ritual Beast Tamer Wen even if another Ritual Beast Tamer Wen was already Special Summoned that turn, because the restriction on Special Summoning Ritual Beast Tamer Wen only applies to the effect of Ritual Beast Tamer Wen itself, not to the effect of Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin. \n\n**Resolution:** The effect will resolve by returning Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin to the Extra Deck, then Special Summoning two banished monsters, including Ritual Beast Tamer Wen, in Defense Position."
