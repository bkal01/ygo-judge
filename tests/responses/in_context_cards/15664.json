    "question": "The effect of a Superheavy Samurai Blowtorch in the hand was activated, targeting a Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler.\n\nIf the effect of Enemy Controller to switch control or Compulsory Evacuation Device are activated so that Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler is no longer on your side of the field, how does this resolve?",
    "answer": "If at the time of the resolution of the effect of Superheavy Samurai Blowtorch the targeted Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler has been returned to the hand by the effect of Compulsory Evacuation Device or has switched control by the effect of Enemy Controller, so that it cannot be targeted for an attack, the effect of Superheavy Samurai Blowtorch is not applied.",
    "llm_answer": "**Answer:** The effect of Superheavy Samurai Blowtorch will still resolve. Since the target, Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler, is no longer on your side of the field, the attack will be redirected to another monster you control, if possible. If you have no other monsters, the attack will proceed without a valid target, effectively becoming a direct attack. This is because the effect of Blowtorch only specifies changing the attack target, not the requirement for the initial target to remain on your side of the field."
