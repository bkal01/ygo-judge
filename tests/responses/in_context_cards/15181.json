    "question": "If Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode has another copy of Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode as an Xyz Material, can the second effect of Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode be activated?",
    "answer": "Unless Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode has Madolche Puddingcess as an Xyz Material, its second effect cannot be activated.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, the second effect of Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode can be activated. The condition for the effect is having a \"Madolche Puddingcess\" as material, and another copy of Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode counts as having \"Madolche Puddingcess\" as material. The scenario will resolve by allowing you to detach 1 material from Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode to Special Summon 1 \"Madolche\" monster from your Deck."
