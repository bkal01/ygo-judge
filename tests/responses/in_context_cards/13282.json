    "question": "If Shaddoll Falco is flipped face-up, can it use its effect to Special Summon El Shaddoll Winda or El Shaddoll Construct?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can target a Fusion Monster with Shaddoll Falco's effect, so El Shaddoll Winda or El Shaddoll Construct can be Special Summoned.",
    "llm_answer": "Shaddoll Falco can Special Summon any \"Shaddoll\" monster from the GY, including El Shaddoll Winda and El Shaddoll Construct, since they are \"Shaddoll\" monsters. **The scenario resolves with Shaddoll Falco Special Summoning the targeted \"Shaddoll\" monster in face-down Defense Position.**"
