    "question": "During my opponent's Battle Phase, my opponent's Photon Thrasher attacks my face-up Attack Position Rebuildeer . During that Damage Step, if I activate Forbidden Lance and make Photon Thrasher lose 800 ATK, so that it is destroyed by battle, can I activate the effect of Rebuildeer ?",
    "answer": "As in this scenario, even if Rebuildeer destroys an opponent's monster by battle during your opponent's turn, you can activate its effect.",
    "llm_answer": "**Yes**, you can activate the effect of Rebuildeer. Rebuildeer's effect triggers when it destroys an opponent's monster by battle. Since Photon Thrasher will be destroyed by battle after losing 800 ATK from Forbidden Lance, Rebuildeer's effect will activate. \n\n**Scenario Resolution**: Rebuildeer will destroy Photon Thrasher by battle, then you can Special Summon a Cyberse monster with 1500 or less ATK from your Graveyard."
