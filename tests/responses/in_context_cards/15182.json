    "answer": "No, you cannot.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can still activate the second effect of Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode. The card's effect does not specify that the card must be shuffled into the Deck; it triggers when a \"Madolche\" card in the GY is shuffled into the Main Deck or returned to the hand, as per Madolche Chateau's effect.\n\n**Resolution:** You will successfully Special Summon a \"Madolche\" monster from your Deck."
