    "question": "If I Link Summon Knightmare Goblin to the Extra Monster Zone, can I activate its effect that allows me to perform an additional Normal Summon that turn?",
    "answer": "Even if you Link Summon Knightmare Goblin to the Extra Monster Zone, you can activate its effect that allows you to perform an additional Normal Summon that turn to a Zone that it points to. While Knightmare Goblin is in the Extra Monster Zone, you cannot perform that additional Normal Summon since it does not point to any Main Monster Zones. However, if you activate the effect of a card such as Trancefamiliar and move Knightmare Goblin to one of your Main Monster Zones, you will then be able to perform the additional Normal Summon if Knightmare Goblin points to another Main Monster Zone.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can activate Knightmare Goblin's effect to perform an additional Normal Summon if it is Link Summoned to the Extra Monster Zone. However, you must discard a card as the cost for activating this effect. If Knightmare Goblin was co-linked when this effect was activated, you can draw a card, and you gain the ability to perform an additional Normal Summon this turn."
