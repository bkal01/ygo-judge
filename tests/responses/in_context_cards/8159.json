    "question": "When Obelisk the Tormentor is Tribute Summoned, how long does its effect that prevents cards and effects from being activated apply? Will this effect prevent cards and effects from being activated for the rest of the Duel?",
    "answer": "The effect of Obelisk the Tormentor that prevents cards and effects from being activated when it is Normal Summoned only applies at the time it is successfully Summoned. This effect does not prevent cards and effects from activating for the rest of the Duel, so after Obelisk the Tormentor has been successfully Tribute Summoned, cards and effects can be activated normally. (For example, when Obelisk the Tormentor is Tribute Summoned, cards such as Bottomless Trap Hole cannot be activated at that time, but cards like Mirror Force can be activated normally when Obelisk the Tormentor declares an attack.)",
    "llm_answer": "**Answer**: The effect of Obelisk the Tormentor that prevents cards and effects from being activated applies only **while it is being Tribute Summoned**. This means once the Summon is complete, players can activate cards and effects normally.\n\n**Resolution**: Players can activate cards and effects as soon as Obelisk's Tribute Summon is successfully completed."
