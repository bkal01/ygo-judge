    "question": "I activate Water of Life and Special Summon a Sangan from my Graveyard. During this turn, if I Tribute that Sangan for a Tribute Summon, can I activate its effect?",
    "answer": "Water of Life prevents you from activating monster effects for the rest of the turn after it resolves, except the effects of the Special Summoned monster that activate on the field. Therefore, in this scenario, the effect of Sangan does not activate when it is sent to the Graveyard after being Special Summoned by the effect of Water of Life.",
    "llm_answer": "**No, you cannot activate Sangan's effect if it is Tributed for a Tribute Summon on the same turn it was Special Summoned by Water of Life.** Water of Life restricts you from activating monster effects, except for the effects of the monster it Special Summons, which does not include Sangan's effect when it is sent to the Graveyard. **The scenario will resolve with Sangan being Tributed and its effect not being able to be activated.**"
