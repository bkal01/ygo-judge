    "question": "I have 2 Set copies of Ancient Gear Reborn. If I activate one Ancient Gear Reborn, can I chain the second copy to it?",
    "answer": "You can only have 1 Ancient Gear Reborn on your field, so when you activate the first copy, you are not able to chain the second copy.",
    "llm_answer": "No, you cannot chain the second copy of Ancient Gear Reborn. Continuous Traps like Ancient Gear Reborn do not start a chain when activated, so there is nothing to chain to. Only cards or effects that start a chain can be chained to.\n\nThe scenario will resolve with you activating one copy of Ancient Gear Reborn, and it will remain on the field as a Continuous Trap."
