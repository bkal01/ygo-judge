    "question": "While the effect of Macro Cosmos is applying, can I still activate Power Wall during damage calculation if I would take battle damage?",
    "answer": "Even while the effect of Macro Cosmos is applying, you can activate Power Wall. In that case, all cards that would be sent from the top of your Deck to the Graveyard are banished instead, but the battle damage you would take is still reduced to 0 normally.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can activate Power Wall. The activation of Power Wall does not require sending cards to the GY; it's the cost of its effect resolution that does. Thus, **Power Wall can be activated, but the cards will be banished instead of going to the GY due to Macro Cosmos.**"
