    "question": "While Imperial Iron Wall is face-up on my field, I Pendulum Summon an Double Iris Magician and White Wing Magician. In this case, is it possible to use White Wing Magician as a <<9241>> monster?",
    "answer": "Even in this scenario, you can use the Pendulum Summoned White Wing Magician as a <<9241>> monster. In that case, due to the effect of Imperial Iron Wall, White Wing Magician is not banished and is added face-up to the Extra Deck.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can use White Wing Magician as a Synchro Material. **Imperial Iron Wall** prevents cards from being banished, but does not stop you from using monsters for a Synchro Summon. **White Wing Magician** will not be banished due to **Imperial Iron Wall**'s effect, allowing you to use it for the Synchro Summon as normal."
