If I activate Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast and there are 3 or more Spell Cards in my Graveyard, how do I apply the part of the effect that returns all of my opponent's monsters in the Extra Monster Zones to the Deck?",
    "question": "My opponent's Knightmare Mermaid and Knightmare Unicorn are in the Extra Monster Zones, in an Extra Link with Knightmare Phoenix, Knightmare Goblin, and Knightmare Cerberus in my opponent's Main Monster Zones. If I activate Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast and there are 3 or more Spell Cards in my Graveyard, how do I apply the part of the effect that returns all of my opponent's monsters in the Extra Monster Zones to the Deck?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, if the effect of Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast resolves and your opponent has 2 monsters in the Extra Monster Zones by forming an Extra Link, both of your opponent's monsters in the Extra Monster Zones are returned. (Knightmare Mermaid and Knightmare Unicorn return to your opponent's Extra Deck.)",
    "llm_answer": "You can apply the effect of **Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast** to shuffle your opponent's monsters from the Extra Monster Zones into the Deck. Since **Knightmare Mermaid** and **Knightmare Unicorn** are in the Extra Monster Zones and your opponent's **Knightmare** monsters are co-linked, they are not protected by their own effects from being shuffled back into the Deck.\n\n**Resolution:** After both players send the top 2 cards of their Deck to the GY, if you have at least 3 Spell Cards in your GY, you can shuffle **Knightmare Mermaid** and **Knightmare Unicorn** from the Extra Monster Zones back into the Deck."
