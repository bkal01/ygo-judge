    "question": "I activate Abyss Actors Back Stage, but then chain my own Needlebug Nest and send 5 cards from the top of my Deck to the Graveyard. As a result, if the only remaining \"Abyss Actor\" Pendulum Monsters in my Deck when Abyss Actors Back Stage resolves are 2 copies of Abyss Actor - Sassy Rookie, what happens?",
    "answer": "The effect of Abyss Actors Back Stage must add 2 \"Abyss Actor\" Pendulum Monsters with different names from your Main Deck to your Extra Deck. In this scenario, since the only \"Abyss Actor\" Pendulum Monsters in your Deck are copies of Abyss Actor - Sassy Rookie, the effect of Abyss Actors Back Stage is not applied. (No monsters are added to your Extra Deck.)",
    "llm_answer": "When \"Abyss Actors Back Stage\" resolves, you cannot add any \"Abyss Actor\" Pendulum Monsters to your Extra Deck because there are no cards with different names available. The effect requires two different names, and since both remaining cards are \"Abyss Actor - Sassy Rookie,\" you cannot fulfill the condition of the card's effect. \n\n**Resolution**: Nothing happens from the effect of \"Abyss Actors Back Stage.\""
