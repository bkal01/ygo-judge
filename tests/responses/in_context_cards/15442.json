    "question": "Can Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond be sent to the Graveyard by its own effect?",
    "answer": "Yes, it can.",
    "llm_answer": "**No,** Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond **cannot** be sent to the Graveyard by its own effect. Its effect specifically states that you can send **another** face-up \"Gem-Knight\" monster you control to the Graveyard, not itself. The scenario will resolve with Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond remaining on the field."
