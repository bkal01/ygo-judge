    "question": "While Anti-Spell Fragrance is applying, if Masked Beast Des Gardius is sent from the field to the Graveyard, will its effect activate?",
    "answer": "Equipping The Mask of Remnants from the Deck by the effect of Masked Beast Des Gardius is not considered activating a Spell Card. Therefore, even while Anti-Spell Fragrance is applying, the effect of Masked Beast Des Gardius will activate as usual, and equip The Mask of Remnants to the targeted monster.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, Masked Beast Des Gardius' effect will activate. The effect triggers when it is sent from the field to the Graveyard, which is not prevented by Anti-Spell Fragrance. The scenario will resolve with Des Gardius' effect activating, allowing you to equip \"The Mask of Remnants\" from your Deck to a face-up monster your opponent controls."
