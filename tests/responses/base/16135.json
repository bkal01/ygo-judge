    "question": "When applying the effect of Legion the Fiend Jester that allows me to Tribute Summon an additional Spellcaster-Type monster, can I Tribute a Double Coston and treat it as 2 Tributes to Tribute Summon a Dark Magician?",
    "answer": "If you want to apply the effect of Legion the Fiend Jester, you must Tribute Summon. In this scenario, if you apply the effect of Double Coston and treat it as 2 Tributes, you can Tribute Double Coston for the Tribute Summon of Dark Magician.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can Tribute Double Coston as 2 Tributes for a Tribute Summon of Dark Magician, but it will still count as only one of your two additional Tribute Summons allowed by Legion the Fiend Jester's effect. Double Coston's effect does not change the count of Tribute Summons, only the number of Tributes."
