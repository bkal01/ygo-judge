    "question": "If the opponent activates Enemy Controller in a chain to the activation of the effect of Super Quantal Mech Beast Magnaliger, Super Quantal Mech Beast Aeroboros, or Super Quantal Mech Beast Grampulse that attaches an Xyz Material to itself, so that control of Super Quantal Mech Beast Magnaliger or similar switches to the opponent, how does this resolve?",
    "answer": "Even in that case, the effect resolves normally.\n\n(A \"Super Quantum Mecha Pilot\" monster in the hand or face-up on your side of the field is attached to the monster that switched control to the opponent as an Xyz Material)",
    "llm_answer": "The Xyz Material attachment effect resolves normally. The control switch from Enemy Controller does not interrupt or negate the effect that attaches the Xyz Material to the Super Quantal Mech Beast."
