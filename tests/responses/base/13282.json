    "question": "If Shaddoll Falco is flipped face-up, can it use its effect to Special Summon El Shaddoll Winda or El Shaddoll Construct?",
    "answer": "Yes, you can target a Fusion Monster with Shaddoll Falco's effect, so El Shaddoll Winda or El Shaddoll Construct can be Special Summoned.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, Shaddoll Falco can use its effect to Special Summon El Shaddoll Winda or El Shaddoll Construct because its effect does not specify that the monster must be added from the Deck, hand, or Graveyard, only that it must be a \"Shaddoll\" monster."
