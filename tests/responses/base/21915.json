In this situation, if a Special Summoned Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon leaves the field, will it be placed on the bottom of the Deck?",
    "answer": "Even if the effects of Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon are negated by Skill Drain, the effect that places it on the bottom of the Deck will be applied when it leaves the field.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, Chaos Emperor, the Dragon of Armageddon will be placed on the bottom of the Deck. Skill Drain negates the effects of monsters while they are on the field, but not their effects that activate when they leave the field."
