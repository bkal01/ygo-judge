    "question": "Can Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond be sent to the Graveyard by its own effect?",
    "answer": "Yes, it can.",
    "llm_answer": "No, Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond cannot be sent to the Graveyard by its own effect. Its effect requires it to be sent to the Graveyard as a cost to activate, but it cannot be used if it would result in the card being sent to the Graveyard by its own effect."
