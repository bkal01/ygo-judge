    "question": "During my opponent's Battle Phase, my opponent's Photon Thrasher attacks my face-up Attack Position Rebuildeer . During that Damage Step, if I activate Forbidden Lance and make Photon Thrasher lose 800 ATK, so that it is destroyed by battle, can I activate the effect of Rebuildeer ?",
    "answer": "As in this scenario, even if Rebuildeer destroys an opponent's monster by battle during your opponent's turn, you can activate its effect.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can activate the effect of **Rebuildeer**. Forbidden Lance reduces the ATK of Photon Thrasher, and since it does not negate effects, Rebuildeer can still activate its effect when it is destroyed by battle."
