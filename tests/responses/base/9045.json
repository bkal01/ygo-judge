    "question": "If Number C39: Utopia Ray is Xyz Summoned by placing it on top of Number 39: Utopia, can the effect of Xyz Change Tactics be activated?",
    "answer": "Even in that case, since this is treated as an Xyz Summon, the effect of Xyz Change Tactics can be activated.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, the effect of Xyz Change Tactics can be activated. Utopia Ray is considered an Xyz Monster that was properly Xyz Summoned, which is all that Xyz Change Tactics requires."
