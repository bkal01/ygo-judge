    "question": "If my Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon attacks my opponent's Flower Cardian Lightflare, and Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon is destroyed by battle, is it possible to activate the effect of Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon that banishes the opponent's battling monster at the end of the Damage Step?",
    "answer": "Even in this scenario, since Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon attacked an opponent's monster, but that monster was not destroyed by battle, you can activate its effect. In this case, since Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon was destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, its effect activates in the Graveyard. Although the effect of Flower Cardian Lightflare negates the effects of monsters that battle \"Flower Cardian\" monsters, the effect of Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon that activates in the Graveyard is not negated.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can activate Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon's effect to banish Flower Cardian Lightflare even if Brave-Eyes was destroyed by battle, as the effect triggers at the end of the Damage Step."
