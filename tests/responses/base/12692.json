    "answer": "Even if the Pendulum Monster P.M. Captor is the only monster on your field, you can activate the second effect of Vampire's Desire. In that case, P.M. Captor is added face-up to the Extra Deck instead of sent to the Graveyard, and the targeted \"Vampire\" monster is not Special Summoned.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can activate the second effect of Vampire's Desire. The effect does not require a monster to be targeted or to leave the field, so P.M. Captor does not prevent its activation."
