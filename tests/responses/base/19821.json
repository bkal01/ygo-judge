    "question": "I activate Abyss Actors Back Stage, but then chain my own Needlebug Nest and send 5 cards from the top of my Deck to the Graveyard. As a result, if the only remaining \"Abyss Actor\" Pendulum Monsters in my Deck when Abyss Actors Back Stage resolves are 2 copies of Abyss Actor - Sassy Rookie, what happens?",
    "answer": "The effect of Abyss Actors Back Stage must add 2 \"Abyss Actor\" Pendulum Monsters with different names from your Main Deck to your Extra Deck. In this scenario, since the only \"Abyss Actor\" Pendulum Monsters in your Deck are copies of Abyss Actor - Sassy Rookie, the effect of Abyss Actors Back Stage is not applied. (No monsters are added to your Extra Deck.)",
    "llm_answer": "**Answer:** Abyss Actors Back Stage will search and add 1 of the Abyss Actor - Sassy Rookie to your hand. **Explanation:** The effect of Abyss Actors Back Stage will still resolve and search for an \"Abyss Actor\" Pendulum Monster in your Deck, even if there is only one type of card left."
