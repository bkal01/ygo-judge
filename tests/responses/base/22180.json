    "question": "If Cyberse Quantum Dragon battles an opponent's Monster Token, can its effect be activated at the start of the Damage Step?",
    "answer": "You can activate the effect of Cyberse Quantum Dragon at the start of the Damage Step when it battles an opponent's Monster Token. In that case, the Token disappears instead of returning to the hand, but Cyberse Quantum Dragon can still make a second attack.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, Cyberse Quantum Dragon's effect can be activated at the start of the Damage Step when it battles a Monster Token. Tokens are considered monsters and can be targeted by effects like Quantum Dragon's."
