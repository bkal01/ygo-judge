    "question": "I have 2 Set copies of Ancient Gear Reborn. If I activate one Ancient Gear Reborn, can I chain the second copy to it?",
    "answer": "You can only have 1 Ancient Gear Reborn on your field, so when you activate the first copy, you are not able to chain the second copy.",
    "llm_answer": "No, you cannot chain the second copy of Ancient Gear Reborn to the first one. Continuous Spell/Trap cards like Ancient Gear Reborn cannot be chained to each other as they do not have Spell Speed 2 or higher."
