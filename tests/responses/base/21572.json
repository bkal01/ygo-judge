If an Elemental HERO Honest Neos is already face-up on the field, can I activate the effect of that Elemental HERO Honest Neos that increases its own ATK this turn?",
    "question": "During this turn, I Link Summoned Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights and used its effect to add Elemental HERO Honest Neos to my hand. If an Elemental HERO Honest Neos is already face-up on the field, can I activate the effect of that Elemental HERO Honest Neos that increases its own ATK this turn?",
    "answer": "The effect of Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights prevents you from activating the effects of monsters with the same name as the Warrior-Type monster added to your hand, including those already face-up on the field. Therefore, in this scenario, you cannot activate the effects of the Elemental HERO Honest Neos in your hand or the one on the field this turn.",
    "llm_answer": "No, you cannot activate the effect of Elemental HERO Honest Neos to increase its ATK this turn. Isolde's effect, which adds a card to your hand, prevents you from Special Summoning monsters from the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn, and Honest Neos's ATK increase effect can only be activated if it was Special Summoned from the Extra Deck."
