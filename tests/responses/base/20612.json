    "question": "I activate Halfway to Forever, targeting a Gagaga Magician and a Gogogo Golem in my Graveyard. If my opponent chains the effect of their D.D. Crow and banishes Gagaga Magician from my Graveyard, how does the effect of Halfway to Forever resolve?",
    "answer": "As in this scenario, if either of the 2 targeted monsters is no longer in the Graveyard when Halfway to Forever resolves, its effect is not applied. (Gogogo Golem remains in the Graveyard, and you do not perform an Xyz Summon.)",
    "llm_answer": "The effect of Halfway to Forever will not Special Summon either monster. Since Gagaga Magician, one of the targets, is no longer in the Graveyard when Halfway to Forever resolves, the entire effect is negated."
