    "question": "While the effect of Macro Cosmos is applying, can a Link Summon be performed?",
    "answer": "Yes, it can. In that case, the monsters used as Link Materials are banished by the effect of Macro Cosmos instead of sent to the Graveyard, but the Link Monster is Special Summoned normally.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, a Link Summon can be performed while Macro Cosmos is applying. Link Summons do not send monsters to the graveyard as cost; instead, they use them as materials, which are not affected by Macro Cosmos' effect."
