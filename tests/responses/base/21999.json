    "question": "I activate Galaxy Trance, targeting a Photon Crusher in my Graveyard. If my opponent chains the effect of D.D. Crow and banishes that Photon Crusher from the Graveyard, how does the effect of Galaxy Trance resolve?",
    "answer": "If the targeted \"Photon\" monster is not in your Graveyard when the effect of Galaxy Trance resolves, the effect is not applied. (No monster is Special Summoned from the Deck either.)",
    "llm_answer": "Galaxy Trance's effect will not resolve successfully. Since the targeted Photon Crusher is no longer in the Graveyard when Galaxy Trance resolves, you cannot Special Summon it."
