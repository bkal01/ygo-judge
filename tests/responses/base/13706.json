    "question": "If Ignoble Knight of Black Laundsallyn is targeted by the last effect of Lady of the Lake, but Raigeki Break is chained, targeting and destroying Ignoble Knight of Black Laundsallyn, how will the effect of Lady of the Lake resolve?",
    "answer": "The effect of Lady of the Lake cannot reduce the Level of Ignoble Knight of Black Laundsallyn by 1, so it is not Special Summoned.",
    "llm_answer": "The effect of Lady of the Lake will not resolve. Since Ignoble Knight of Black Laundsallyn is destroyed before Lady of the Lake's effect resolves, there is no valid target for the effect to apply to."
