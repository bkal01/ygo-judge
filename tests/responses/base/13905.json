    "question": "Can the effect of Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin be activated by targeting a Ritual Beast Tamer Wen if another Ritual Beast Tamer Wen was already Special Summoned that turn?",
    "answer": "The effect of Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin can only be activated by targeting a \"Ritual Beast\" monster that has not yet been Special Summoned that turn. (If you do not have 2 banished \"Ritual Beast\" monsters that have not been Special Summoned that turn, you cannot activate the effect of Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin.)",
    "llm_answer": "No, the effect of Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin cannot be activated to target another Ritual Beast Tamer Wen if one has already been Special Summoned that turn, as per the card's restriction on special summoning only one Ritual Beast Tamer per turn."
