If I activate Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast and there are 3 or more Spell Cards in my Graveyard, how do I apply the part of the effect that returns all of my opponent's monsters in the Extra Monster Zones to the Deck?",
    "question": "My opponent's Knightmare Mermaid and Knightmare Unicorn are in the Extra Monster Zones, in an Extra Link with Knightmare Phoenix, Knightmare Goblin, and Knightmare Cerberus in my opponent's Main Monster Zones. If I activate Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast and there are 3 or more Spell Cards in my Graveyard, how do I apply the part of the effect that returns all of my opponent's monsters in the Extra Monster Zones to the Deck?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, if the effect of Sky Striker Maneuver - Vector Blast resolves and your opponent has 2 monsters in the Extra Monster Zones by forming an Extra Link, both of your opponent's monsters in the Extra Monster Zones are returned. (Knightmare Mermaid and Knightmare Unicorn return to your opponent's Extra Deck.)",
    "llm_answer": "The Knightmare monsters in the Extra Monster Zones will not return to the Deck because they are part of an Extra Link, which prevents them from being returned to the Extra Deck by card effects. Vector Blast's effect to return monsters to the Deck only applies to monsters not involved in an Extra Link."
