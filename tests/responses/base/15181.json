    "question": "If Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode has another copy of Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode as an Xyz Material, can the second effect of Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode be activated?",
    "answer": "Unless Madolche Puddingcess Chocolat-a-la-Mode has Madolche Puddingcess as an Xyz Material, its second effect cannot be activated.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, the second effect can be activated. The restriction on activating the effect applies to the card itself, not to its materials, so having another copy as an Xyz Material does not prevent the activation."
