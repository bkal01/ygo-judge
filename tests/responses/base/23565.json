    "question": "Can the effect of Firewall Dragon Darkfluid - Neo Tempest Terahertz be activated while Gozen Match is applying?",
    "answer": "Yes, it can.\n\nAfter resolving the effect of Firewall Dragon Darkfluid - Neo Tempest Terahertz, if it is treated as 2 or more different Attributes, it must be sent to the Graveyard immediately.",
    "llm_answer": "No, the effect of Firewall Dragon Darkfluid - Neo Tempest Terahertz cannot be activated while Gozen Match is applying. Gozen Match restricts players to only control monsters of the same Attribute, and Neo Tempest Terahertz's effect would result in controlling monsters of different Attributes."
