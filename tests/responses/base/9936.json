    "question": "While Imperial Iron Wall is face-up on my field, I Pendulum Summon an Double Iris Magician and White Wing Magician. In this case, is it possible to use White Wing Magician as a <<9241>> monster?",
    "answer": "Even in this scenario, you can use the Pendulum Summoned White Wing Magician as a <<9241>> monster. In that case, due to the effect of Imperial Iron Wall, White Wing Magician is not banished and is added face-up to the Extra Deck.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can use White Wing Magician as a Level 4 monster for the Pendulum Summon, but you cannot send it to the Extra Deck as it is not a Synchro or Xyz Material due to Imperial Iron Wall's effect preventing cards from being banished."
