    "question": "When you target a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link Monster\u00a0with\u00a0Monster Reincarnation, how does the effect resolve if\u00a0Stellarknight Constellar Diamond that has Xyz Material attached is face-up on the field?",
    "answer": "Monster Reincarnation's effect is an effect that returns a monster from the Graveyard to the hand, so even if you target a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link Monster, the effect of\u00a0Stellarknight Constellar Diamond will be applied and the targeted monster will be banished instead.",
    "llm_answer": "The targeted monster will be shuffled into the Extra Deck. Stellarknight Constellar Diamond's effect does not change the location where the monster is returned."
