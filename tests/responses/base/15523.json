Then, if the second effect of Brilliant Fusion is activated, but Forbidden Lance is chained, making Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli unaffected by Spell effects, what does its ATK and DEF become?

    "question": "Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli is Fusion Summoned by Brilliant Fusion. Then, if the second effect of Brilliant Fusion is activated, but Forbidden Lance is chained, making Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli unaffected by Spell effects, what does its ATK and DEF become? Also, if the effect of Brilliant Fusion has already been applied, but Forbidden Lance is then activated, making Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli unaffected by Spell effects, what does its ATK and DEF become?",
    "answer": "When the effect of Brilliant Fusion resolves, if the Fusion Monster is unaffected by Spell effects, it does not gain ATK and DEF from the effect of Brilliant Fusion. Also, if the effect of Brilliant Fusion has already been applied, and the Fusion Monster then becomes unaffected by Spell effects, the ATK and DEF gained by the effect continues to apply. (From that value, the effect of Forbidden Lance will make the monster lose 800 ATK.)",
    "llm_answer": "1. **If Forbidden Lance is chained to Brilliant Fusion's second effect:** Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli will remain at 2400 ATK and 1000 DEF, because the effect of Forbidden Lance makes it unaffected by Brilliant Fusion's effect.\n\n   **If Forbidden Lance is activated after Brilliant Fusion's effect has already been applied:** Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli's ATK and DEF will revert back to 2400 ATK and 1000 DEF, as Lance's effect removes the modification from Brilliant Fusion."
