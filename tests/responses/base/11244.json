    "answer": "In this case, even if Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark is no longer in your Graveyard when the effect of Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy resolves, the targeted monster on the field still gains the ATK normally.",
    "llm_answer": "The effect of Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy will still resolve normally because its effect does not require Number 37: Hope Woven Dragon Spider Shark to remain in the Graveyard for its activation or resolution."
