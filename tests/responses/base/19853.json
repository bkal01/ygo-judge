    "question": "A Valkyrion the Magna Warrior that was Special Summoned by the effect of Delta The Magnet Warrior is destroyed by battle or card effect and sent to the Graveyard. Can that Valkyrion the Magnet Warrior then be Special Summoned from the Graveyard by the effect of Monster Reborn?",
    "answer": "A Valkyrion the Magna Warrior that was Special Summoned by the effect of Delta The Magnet Warrior is not considered to have been properly Special Summoned by its own procedure. If that Valkyrion the Magna Warrior is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard, it cannot be Special Summoned again by the effect of Monster Reborn.",
    "llm_answer": "No, it cannot. Valkyrion the Magna Warrior, when Special Summoned by Delta The Magnet Warrior, is treated as a Fusion Monster, and as such, cannot be Special Summoned by Monster Reborn."
