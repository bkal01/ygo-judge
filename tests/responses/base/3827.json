    "question": "Dragon's Rebirth is activated by targeting a face-up Darkflare Dragon in my Monster Zone. If Book of Moon is chained, and Darkflare Dragon is changed to face-down Defense Position, how does Dragon's Rebirth resolve?",
    "answer": "When resolving Dragon's Rebirth, if the targeted Dragon-Type monster has been changed to face-down Defense Position, it is not banished, and the part of the effect that Special Summons a monster is not applied.",
    "llm_answer": "Dragon's Rebirth will still resolve successfully and Special Summon a monster from your Graveyard. The requirement for Dragon's Rebirth is to target a face-up Dragon monster, which was met when it was activated."
