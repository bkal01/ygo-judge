    "question": "If a Spell and Trap Card treated as a Monster Card by the effect of Magical Hats is destroyed in battle, can the effect of First-Aid Squad in the Graveyard be activated?",
    "answer": "Since the Spell and Trap Cards Special Summoned as Monster Cards by the effect of Magical Hats are treated as Normal Monsters, if they are destroyed by battle, the effect of First-Aid Squad in the Graveyard can be activated.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, the effect of First-Aid Squad can be activated. When a card treated as a Monster by Magical Hats is destroyed in battle, it is considered to be destroyed on the field, thus triggering First-Aid Squad's effect."
