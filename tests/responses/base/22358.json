    "question": "When Special Summoning Performapal Kuribohble with its own effect, can I Special Summon it in Defense Position?",
    "answer": "When Special Summoning Performapal Kuribohble with its own effect, you can Special Summon it in face-up Defense Position instead of face-up Attack Position. It becomes the new attack target and damage calculation is conducted as usual. If your opponent attacked with a monster equipped with Fairy Meteor Crush and would inflict piercing battle damage, the effect of Performapal Kuribohble makes you gain Life Points instead.",
    "llm_answer": "No, you cannot Special Summon Performapal Kuribohble in Defense Position with its own effect; its effect specifies that it is Special Summoned in face-up Attack Position."
