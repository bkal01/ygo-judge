    "question": "Shrink is activated by targeting Destiny HERO - Dystopia, and its ATK becomes 1400. In this situation, can I activate the effect of Destiny HERO - Dystopia that destroys a card on the field?",
    "answer": "If the effect of Shrink is applied, the halved original ATK is treated as the monster's new original ATK. Therefore, in this scenario, the original ATK of Destiny HERO - Dystopia is not different from its current ATK, so you cannot activate its effect that destroys a card on the field.",
    "llm_answer": "No, you cannot activate Destiny HERO - Dystopia's effect because its ATK must be higher than the targeted card's ATK to activate its effect. Since its ATK was reduced to 1400 by Shrink, it can't meet the activation requirement."
