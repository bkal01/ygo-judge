    "question": "If you have Shaddoll Zefranaga and Zefraniu, Secret of the Yang Zing in your Pendulum Zones, which monsters can be Pendulum Summoned?",
    "answer": "In that case, since the Pendulum Effects of both cards are applied, as an end result you can only Pendulum Summon \"Zefra\" monsters.",
    "llm_answer": "With Shaddoll Zefranaga (Scale 1) and Zefraniu, Secret of the Yang Zing (Scale 7) in your Pendulum Zones, you can Pendulum Summon monsters with levels between 2 and 6, inclusive. This is because Pendulum Summoning allows you to summon monsters whose levels are between the Pendulum Scales, excluding the scales themselves."
