    "answer": "When performing a Fusion Summon using the effect of Gem-Knight Phantom Quartz, you can include Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and/or Link Monsters as materials. For example, if you Fusion Summon a Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli, which requires Gem-Knight Lapis and another \"Gem-Knight\" monster, you can use a Gem-Knight Lapis and a Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond in your Graveyard as materials. (Gem-Knight Lapis returns to the Deck, but Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond returns to the Extra Deck.)",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can use any of those types of monsters from the Graveyard or that are banished as materials for the Fusion Summon. This is because the effect of Gem-Knight Phantom Quartz does not specify any restrictions on the type of monsters used as materials beyond being in the Graveyard or banished."
