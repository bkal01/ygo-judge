    "question": "My opponent activates Icarus Attack, targeting Megalosmasher X and Lost World on my field. At this time, can I apply the effect of Lost World that destroys Dinosaur-Type monsters in my hand or Deck instead?",
    "answer": "Even if Lost World and a Normal Monster on the field would be destroyed at the same time, as in this scenario, you can apply the effect of Lost World that destroys Dinosaur-Type monsters in your hand or Deck instead. (In this scenario, Lost World itself is destroyed by the effect of Icarus Attack, but Megalosmasher X is not destroyed, and you destroy 1 Dinosaur-Type monster in your hand or Deck instead.)",
    "llm_answer": "No, you cannot apply Lost World's effect to replace the targeted destruction with Dinosaur-Type monsters in your hand or Deck because Icarus Attack does not destroy the cards; it sends them to the Graveyard. Thus, Lost World's replacement effect does not apply."
