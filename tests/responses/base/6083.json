    "question": "During my opponent's turn, I activate Urgent Ritual Art by banishing Machine Angel Ritual from my Graveyard, and Ritual Summon a Cyber Angel Dakini. In this case, can I activate the effect of Cyber Angel Dakini that makes my opponent send a monster on their field to the Graveyard?",
    "answer": "When resolving the effect of Urgent Ritual Art that was activated by banishing Machine Angel Ritual, if Cyber Angel Dakini is Ritual Summoned during your opponent's turn, you can still activate its effect. Note that even if Urgent Ritual Art was activated as Chain Link 2 or higher, and Cyber Angel Dakini is Ritual Summoned when it resolves, you can activate the effect of Cyber Angel Dakini.",
    "llm_answer": "Yes, you can activate Cyber Angel Dakini's effect to make your opponent send a monster to the Graveyard. Urgent Ritual Art does not state that the Ritual Summoned monster cannot activate its effects."
