    "question": "A Legendary Ocean is face-up in my Field Zone. In this situation, I activate the first effect of <<11976>> Jr. by targeting a Graydle Dragon in my Graveyard. In this case, if I want to Special Summon an Aqua-Type monster from my hand, what Level monster can I Special Summon?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, the Graydle Dragon that is Special Summoned from the Graveyard is Level 8, but its Level is reduced to 7 by the effect of A Legendary Ocean. In this case, if you want to Special Summon an Aqua-Type monster from your hand with the same Level, you will Special Summon a Level 7 monster. Note that since the effect of A Legendary Ocean also reduces the Levels of WATER monsters in your hand by 1, you could Special Summon an Aqua-Type WATER monster such as Mobius the Mega Monarch treated as Level 7 in this case.",
    "llm_answer": "You can Special Summon an Aqua-Type monster with Level 7 or lower from your hand. Since **A Legendary Ocean** reduces the Level of WATER monsters in your hand by 1, you can summon a monster that would normally be Level 8."
